**[00:16]** right, thanks everybody for joining

**[00:16]** right, thanks everybody for joining today. My name is Dennis Linkov. I lead

**[00:17]** today. My name is Dennis Linkov. I lead

**[00:17]** today. My name is Dennis Linkov. I lead the machine learning team at Wisdocs and

**[00:19]** the machine learning team at Wisdocs and

**[00:19]** the machine learning team at Wisdocs and I'll be talking about hiring a modern AI

**[00:21]** I'll be talking about hiring a modern AI

**[00:21]** I'll be talking about hiring a modern AI team.

**[00:23]** team.

**[00:23]** team. So, who's heard this message before? We

**[00:25]** So, who's heard this message before? We

**[00:25]** So, who's heard this message before? We are now an AI first company. We've seen

**[00:28]** are now an AI first company. We've seen

**[00:28]** are now an AI first company. We've seen companies like Shopify, Dolingo, Zapier

**[00:30]** companies like Shopify, Dolingo, Zapier

**[00:30]** companies like Shopify, Dolingo, Zapier all make these announcements saying that

**[00:32]** all make these announcements saying that

**[00:32]** all make these announcements saying that they're AI first companies

**[00:34]** they're AI first companies

**[00:34]** they're AI first companies and they're saying that there are new

**[00:36]** and they're saying that there are new

**[00:36]** and they're saying that there are new expectations that before you hire a

**[00:38]** expectations that before you hire a

**[00:38]** expectations that before you hire a person, you need to make the the claim

**[00:40]** person, you need to make the the claim

**[00:40]** person, you need to make the the claim that you can't hire an AI agent or use

**[00:42]** that you can't hire an AI agent or use

**[00:42]** that you can't hire an AI agent or use AI.

**[00:44]** AI.

**[00:44]** AI. We're now seeing big tech companies and

**[00:46]** We're now seeing big tech companies and

**[00:46]** We're now seeing big tech companies and many companies in general sharing how

**[00:47]** many companies in general sharing how

**[00:47]** many companies in general sharing how much code is being written by AI systems

**[00:50]** much code is being written by AI systems

**[00:50]** much code is being written by AI systems and how this is going to lead to the

**[00:51]** and how this is going to lead to the

**[00:51]** and how this is going to lead to the extinction of the software engineer.

**[00:54]** extinction of the software engineer.

**[00:54]** extinction of the software engineer. So now if you're in the position to hire

**[00:56]** So now if you're in the position to hire

**[00:56]** So now if you're in the position to hire people, you'll ask the question now

**[00:58]** people, you'll ask the question now

**[00:58]** people, you'll ask the question now what?


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:00]** what?

**[01:00]** what? So I'm going to talk about three main

**[01:01]** So I'm going to talk about three main

**[01:01]** So I'm going to talk about three main themes today. The first one is the

**[01:03]** themes today. The first one is the

**[01:03]** themes today. The first one is the anatomy of an AI team. The second is the

**[01:05]** anatomy of an AI team. The second is the

**[01:05]** anatomy of an AI team. The second is the evolution of a generalist and the third

**[01:07]** evolution of a generalist and the third

**[01:07]** evolution of a generalist and the third is the question of hiring.

**[01:09]** is the question of hiring.

**[01:10]** is the question of hiring. So let's start off with the anatomy of a

**[01:11]** So let's start off with the anatomy of a

**[01:11]** So let's start off with the anatomy of a team.

**[01:13]** team.

**[01:13]** team. So there is spectrum of different

**[01:14]** So there is spectrum of different

**[01:14]** So there is spectrum of different companies and this is where we should

**[01:16]** companies and this is where we should

**[01:16]** companies and this is where we should start. We have technology companies

**[01:17]** start. We have technology companies

**[01:17]** start. We have technology companies where technology is the core value

**[01:19]** where technology is the core value

**[01:19]** where technology is the core value proposition that is being offered. We

**[01:21]** proposition that is being offered. We

**[01:21]** proposition that is being offered. We know big tech companies. as we know many

**[01:23]** know big tech companies. as we know many

**[01:23]** know big tech companies. as we know many startups. There's also verticalized

**[01:25]** startups. There's also verticalized

**[01:25]** startups. There's also verticalized solutions or services companies such as

**[01:27]** solutions or services companies such as

**[01:27]** solutions or services companies such as Palunteer or the company I work at

**[01:28]** Palunteer or the company I work at

**[01:28]** Palunteer or the company I work at Wisdocs and there's also tech- enabled

**[01:30]** Wisdocs and there's also tech- enabled

**[01:30]** Wisdocs and there's also tech- enabled companies where the core product is not

**[01:32]** companies where the core product is not

**[01:32]** companies where the core product is not technology but it is something that

**[01:34]** technology but it is something that

**[01:34]** technology but it is something that benefits dramatically from from good

**[01:35]** benefits dramatically from from good

**[01:35]** benefits dramatically from from good tech. You can think about banks,

**[01:37]** tech. You can think about banks,

**[01:37]** tech. You can think about banks, retailers, small and medium businesses.

**[01:40]** retailers, small and medium businesses.

**[01:40]** retailers, small and medium businesses. So who here is in each group? Who here

**[01:42]** So who here is in each group? Who here

**[01:42]** So who here is in each group? Who here is at a tech company? Who here is at a

**[01:45]** is at a tech company? Who here is at a

**[01:45]** is at a tech company? Who here is at a verticalized or services company? Who

**[01:47]** verticalized or services company? Who

**[01:47]** verticalized or services company? Who here is in tech enabled? Okay, pretty

**[01:50]** here is in tech enabled? Okay, pretty

**[01:50]** here is in tech enabled? Okay, pretty good mix.

**[01:52]** good mix.

**[01:52]** good mix. Now, each of these different companies

**[01:53]** Now, each of these different companies

**[01:53]** Now, each of these different companies have different challenges. Typically, in

**[01:55]** have different challenges. Typically, in

**[01:55]** have different challenges. Typically, in a technology company where we've seen

**[01:57]** a technology company where we've seen

**[01:57]** a technology company where we've seen blunders is the lack of domain knowledge

**[01:59]** blunders is the lack of domain knowledge

**[01:59]** blunders is the lack of domain knowledge when launching a product, there's


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:00]** when launching a product, there's

**[02:00]** when launching a product, there's usually some kind of business

**[02:01]** usually some kind of business

**[02:01]** usually some kind of business misalignment with technology. In the

**[02:03]** misalignment with technology. In the

**[02:03]** misalignment with technology. In the middle, either everything goes right or

**[02:05]** middle, either everything goes right or

**[02:05]** middle, either everything goes right or everything goes awfully poorly. And on

**[02:08]** everything goes awfully poorly. And on

**[02:08]** everything goes awfully poorly. And on the tech enabled side, there's usually

**[02:09]** the tech enabled side, there's usually

**[02:09]** the tech enabled side, there's usually some kind of tech challenge, right?

**[02:10]** some kind of tech challenge, right?

**[02:10]** some kind of tech challenge, right? Because tech is not your your core value

**[02:12]** Because tech is not your your core value

**[02:12]** Because tech is not your your core value proposition.

**[02:14]** proposition.

**[02:14]** proposition. So, you make different decisions based

**[02:15]** So, you make different decisions based

**[02:16]** So, you make different decisions based on this, right? You typically buy data

**[02:17]** on this, right? You typically buy data

**[02:17]** on this, right? You typically buy data or buy expertise if you're a tech

**[02:19]** or buy expertise if you're a tech

**[02:19]** or buy expertise if you're a tech company, right? you go to a vendor and

**[02:21]** company, right? you go to a vendor and

**[02:21]** company, right? you go to a vendor and say, "Give me labeled data." In the

**[02:23]** say, "Give me labeled data." In the

**[02:23]** say, "Give me labeled data." In the middle, you either have everything or

**[02:25]** middle, you either have everything or

**[02:25]** middle, you either have everything or you have nothing. Uh, and from a tech-

**[02:27]** you have nothing. Uh, and from a tech-

**[02:27]** you have nothing. Uh, and from a tech- enabled company, usually by technology,

**[02:29]** enabled company, usually by technology,

**[02:29]** enabled company, usually by technology, either through a service provider or uh

**[02:31]** either through a service provider or uh

**[02:31]** either through a service provider or uh a true antenna solution.

**[02:35]** a true antenna solution.

**[02:35]** a true antenna solution. Now, I bring this up because every

**[02:37]** Now, I bring this up because every

**[02:37]** Now, I bring this up because every company, every organization, and every

**[02:39]** company, every organization, and every

**[02:39]** company, every organization, and every person has a different perspective on

**[02:40]** person has a different perspective on

**[02:40]** person has a different perspective on the role of technology solving our

**[02:42]** the role of technology solving our

**[02:42]** the role of technology solving our world's problems.

**[02:44]** world's problems.

**[02:44]** world's problems. This is my stance. I think we have 90%

**[02:46]** This is my stance. I think we have 90%

**[02:46]** This is my stance. I think we have 90% of the technology to solve the problems

**[02:48]** of the technology to solve the problems

**[02:48]** of the technology to solve the problems of humanity. Now, this might be a

**[02:50]** of humanity. Now, this might be a

**[02:50]** of humanity. Now, this might be a controversial perspective, but I'll show

**[02:52]** controversial perspective, but I'll show

**[02:52]** controversial perspective, but I'll show you why.

**[02:54]** you why.

**[02:54]** you why. The fax market still exists.

**[02:58]** The fax market still exists.

**[02:58]** The fax market still exists. Billions of dollars are spent on faxes,


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:00]** Billions of dollars are spent on faxes,

**[03:00]** Billions of dollars are spent on faxes, and the market is growing.

**[03:09]** In 2017, only 3% of payments in the US

**[03:09]** In 2017, only 3% of payments in the US were contact lists. That number is now

**[03:11]** were contact lists. That number is now

**[03:11]** were contact lists. That number is now higher, but we're still paying in

**[03:13]** higher, but we're still paying in

**[03:13]** higher, but we're still paying in archaic ways. Checks are still a massive

**[03:15]** archaic ways. Checks are still a massive

**[03:15]** archaic ways. Checks are still a massive part of the market.

**[03:18]** part of the market.

**[03:18]** part of the market. And it took 40 years after the

**[03:19]** And it took 40 years after the

**[03:20]** And it took 40 years after the introduction of personal computing of

**[03:21]** introduction of personal computing of

**[03:21]** introduction of personal computing of the internet for medical systems and

**[03:24]** the internet for medical systems and

**[03:24]** the internet for medical systems and electronic medical records to become

**[03:26]** electronic medical records to become

**[03:26]** electronic medical records to become digital. This number is much higher now.

**[03:28]** digital. This number is much higher now.

**[03:28]** digital. This number is much higher now. But it takes time for technology to be

**[03:30]** But it takes time for technology to be

**[03:30]** But it takes time for technology to be adopted. And many of you might have seen

**[03:32]** adopted. And many of you might have seen

**[03:32]** adopted. And many of you might have seen this in your industry in your job as

**[03:34]** this in your industry in your job as

**[03:34]** this in your industry in your job as well that technology is not the thing

**[03:35]** well that technology is not the thing

**[03:35]** well that technology is not the thing that's stopping you from achieving

**[03:36]** that's stopping you from achieving

**[03:36]** that's stopping you from achieving success.

**[03:38]** success.

**[03:38]** success. So this is the core question. Is

**[03:40]** So this is the core question. Is

**[03:40]** So this is the core question. Is technology the limitation of our

**[03:41]** technology the limitation of our

**[03:42]** technology the limitation of our success?

**[03:46]** And it's not about technology, it's how

**[03:46]** And it's not about technology, it's how we use technology. And the way you build

**[03:48]** we use technology. And the way you build

**[03:48]** we use technology. And the way you build your team should reflect this by

**[03:50]** your team should reflect this by

**[03:50]** your team should reflect this by understanding the problems that you

**[03:51]** understanding the problems that you

**[03:51]** understanding the problems that you have.

**[03:53]** have.

**[03:53]** have. So going to this question of do you need

**[03:55]** So going to this question of do you need

**[03:55]** So going to this question of do you need to hire an AI researcher? A lot of times

**[03:58]** to hire an AI researcher? A lot of times

**[03:58]** to hire an AI researcher? A lot of times when Chad GPT was coming out, every team


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:00]** when Chad GPT was coming out, every team

**[04:00]** when Chad GPT was coming out, every team is like I need an AI engineer. I need an

**[04:02]** is like I need an AI engineer. I need an

**[04:02]** is like I need an AI engineer. I need an AI researcher. And it's not always smart

**[04:04]** AI researcher. And it's not always smart

**[04:04]** AI researcher. And it's not always smart to do so, right? Up until you hit a

**[04:06]** to do so, right? Up until you hit a

**[04:06]** to do so, right? Up until you hit a certain scale or a certain need of

**[04:07]** certain scale or a certain need of

**[04:07]** certain scale or a certain need of specialty, it does not make sense to

**[04:09]** specialty, it does not make sense to

**[04:09]** specialty, it does not make sense to hire an AI researcher to work on models.

**[04:11]** hire an AI researcher to work on models.

**[04:11]** hire an AI researcher to work on models. Free training models, even fine-tuning

**[04:13]** Free training models, even fine-tuning

**[04:13]** Free training models, even fine-tuning models of a certain capacity is not

**[04:15]** models of a certain capacity is not

**[04:15]** models of a certain capacity is not necessarily the first thing that you

**[04:16]** necessarily the first thing that you

**[04:16]** necessarily the first thing that you need to achieve the value that you need

**[04:18]** need to achieve the value that you need

**[04:18]** need to achieve the value that you need to get. There's a lot of transformation

**[04:20]** to get. There's a lot of transformation

**[04:20]** to get. There's a lot of transformation work that that goes in before that.

**[04:23]** work that that goes in before that.

**[04:23]** work that that goes in before that. Now, in certain domains, the best tech

**[04:24]** Now, in certain domains, the best tech

**[04:24]** Now, in certain domains, the best tech is essential, right? So, if you're

**[04:26]** is essential, right? So, if you're

**[04:26]** is essential, right? So, if you're working at OpenAI or model provider,

**[04:28]** working at OpenAI or model provider,

**[04:28]** working at OpenAI or model provider, Anthropic Google or some of the

**[04:30]** Anthropic Google or some of the

**[04:30]** Anthropic Google or some of the startups, you want the best team who's

**[04:31]** startups, you want the best team who's

**[04:31]** startups, you want the best team who's working on that because that is a

**[04:33]** working on that because that is a

**[04:33]** working on that because that is a product as we covered.

**[04:36]** product as we covered.

**[04:36]** product as we covered. So here I'll I'll propose a wager for

**[04:37]** So here I'll I'll propose a wager for

**[04:38]** So here I'll I'll propose a wager for you. Are people here familiar with

**[04:39]** you. Are people here familiar with

**[04:39]** you. Are people here familiar with Pascal's wager philosophy? I'll give you

**[04:42]** Pascal's wager philosophy? I'll give you

**[04:42]** Pascal's wager philosophy? I'll give you the successor of that Ampere's wager if

**[04:44]** the successor of that Ampere's wager if

**[04:44]** the successor of that Ampere's wager if you're familiar with graphics card

**[04:46]** you're familiar with graphics card

**[04:46]** you're familiar with graphics card architectures.

**[04:48]** architectures.

**[04:48]** architectures. Here's your trade. You trade your team

**[04:50]** Here's your trade. You trade your team

**[04:50]** Here's your trade. You trade your team for five researchers from the top labs.

**[04:53]** for five researchers from the top labs.

**[04:53]** for five researchers from the top labs. And maybe you need to throw in some cash

**[04:54]** And maybe you need to throw in some cash

**[04:54]** And maybe you need to throw in some cash and first round picks for that as well.

**[04:57]** and first round picks for that as well.

**[04:57]** and first round picks for that as well. But do you make this trade?

**[04:59]** But do you make this trade?

**[04:59]** But do you make this trade? Do you trade your team that has domain


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:01]** Do you trade your team that has domain

**[05:01]** Do you trade your team that has domain knowledge has worked in the area for

**[05:03]** knowledge has worked in the area for

**[05:03]** knowledge has worked in the area for five AI researchers? I want you to think

**[05:05]** five AI researchers? I want you to think

**[05:05]** five AI researchers? I want you to think about that.

**[05:07]** about that.

**[05:07]** about that. So we go back to the question of what

**[05:08]** So we go back to the question of what

**[05:08]** So we go back to the question of what does an AI team need to do?

**[05:15]** There's a lot of stuff, right? We start

**[05:15]** There's a lot of stuff, right? We start off with defining use cases. We want to

**[05:17]** off with defining use cases. We want to

**[05:17]** off with defining use cases. We want to go through and integrate with products,

**[05:19]** go through and integrate with products,

**[05:19]** go through and integrate with products, right? We're not doing green field

**[05:20]** right? We're not doing green field

**[05:20]** right? We're not doing green field everywhere. We want to measure ROI, find

**[05:22]** everywhere. We want to measure ROI, find

**[05:22]** everywhere. We want to measure ROI, find the right data. We want to test and

**[05:24]** the right data. We want to test and

**[05:24]** the right data. We want to test and refine workflows, build the interfaces

**[05:26]** refine workflows, build the interfaces

**[05:26]** refine workflows, build the interfaces we need for success, sell this product,

**[05:28]** we need for success, sell this product,

**[05:28]** we need for success, sell this product, and make our customers care.

**[05:31]** and make our customers care.

**[05:31]** and make our customers care. And it's not one person who does this

**[05:33]** And it's not one person who does this

**[05:33]** And it's not one person who does this job. You can't just say, "AI

**[05:35]** job. You can't just say, "AI

**[05:35]** job. You can't just say, "AI researchers, go make me $10 million from

**[05:38]** researchers, go make me $10 million from

**[05:38]** researchers, go make me $10 million from this product unless a very specific

**[05:40]** this product unless a very specific

**[05:40]** this product unless a very specific niche.

**[05:43]** niche.

**[05:43]** niche. So this means your success is not one

**[05:45]** So this means your success is not one

**[05:45]** So this means your success is not one job unless you're a founder, but we'll

**[05:47]** job unless you're a founder, but we'll

**[05:47]** job unless you're a founder, but we'll skip that.

**[05:49]** skip that.

**[05:49]** skip that. So the goal here is that you need to

**[05:50]** So the goal here is that you need to

**[05:50]** So the goal here is that you need to have a comprehensive AI team and you

**[05:52]** have a comprehensive AI team and you

**[05:52]** have a comprehensive AI team and you need to figure out how are you going to

**[05:53]** need to figure out how are you going to

**[05:53]** need to figure out how are you going to structure that.

**[05:56]** structure that.

**[05:56]** structure that. And the thing that we need to remember

**[05:57]** And the thing that we need to remember

**[05:57]** And the thing that we need to remember is that companies aren't just one team.

**[05:59]** is that companies aren't just one team.

**[05:59]** is that companies aren't just one team. It's not just my AI team owns this small


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:02]** It's not just my AI team owns this small

**[06:02]** It's not just my AI team owns this small segment, this deployment or whatever.

**[06:04]** segment, this deployment or whatever.

**[06:04]** segment, this deployment or whatever. Otherwise, you ship your org chart and

**[06:06]** Otherwise, you ship your org chart and

**[06:06]** Otherwise, you ship your org chart and you get some weird product behaviors.

**[06:10]** you get some weird product behaviors.

**[06:10]** you get some weird product behaviors. So identify to yourself what is your

**[06:12]** So identify to yourself what is your

**[06:12]** So identify to yourself what is your bottleneck? What is stopping you from

**[06:13]** bottleneck? What is stopping you from

**[06:13]** bottleneck? What is stopping you from achieving success?

**[06:16]** achieving success?

**[06:16]** achieving success? Is it shipping features? Is it acquiring

**[06:19]** Is it shipping features? Is it acquiring

**[06:19]** Is it shipping features? Is it acquiring users? Is it retaining users? Are you

**[06:21]** users? Is it retaining users? Are you

**[06:21]** users? Is it retaining users? Are you monetizing correctly? Are there

**[06:23]** monetizing correctly? Are there

**[06:23]** monetizing correctly? Are there scalability issues? Are there

**[06:25]** scalability issues? Are there

**[06:25]** scalability issues? Are there reliability and observability issues?

**[06:27]** reliability and observability issues?

**[06:28]** reliability and observability issues? Right? All of us have probably run into

**[06:29]** Right? All of us have probably run into

**[06:29]** Right? All of us have probably run into these things as we are deploying AI

**[06:31]** these things as we are deploying AI

**[06:31]** these things as we are deploying AI products. So, we need to make sure we

**[06:33]** products. So, we need to make sure we

**[06:33]** products. So, we need to make sure we can prioritize all these things and hire

**[06:35]** can prioritize all these things and hire

**[06:35]** can prioritize all these things and hire accordingly.

**[06:36]** accordingly.

**[06:36]** accordingly. And these are all questions that you

**[06:38]** And these are all questions that you

**[06:38]** And these are all questions that you need to answer when building an AI team.

**[06:42]** need to answer when building an AI team.

**[06:42]** need to answer when building an AI team. The key takeaway here is what kind of

**[06:44]** The key takeaway here is what kind of

**[06:44]** The key takeaway here is what kind of team do you need? and only you know that

**[06:46]** team do you need? and only you know that

**[06:46]** team do you need? and only you know that answer.

**[06:47]** answer.

**[06:47]** answer. Let's talk about generalists and why I

**[06:49]** Let's talk about generalists and why I

**[06:49]** Let's talk about generalists and why I think they're important.

**[06:51]** think they're important.

**[06:51]** think they're important. So in 2021 I was building uh first

**[06:54]** So in 2021 I was building uh first

**[06:54]** So in 2021 I was building uh first machine learning team and I adopted an

**[06:56]** machine learning team and I adopted an

**[06:56]** machine learning team and I adopted an approach where we hired generalists. We

**[06:58]** approach where we hired generalists. We

**[06:58]** approach where we hired generalists. We supported them by automation across the


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:00]** supported them by automation across the

**[07:00]** supported them by automation across the board.

**[07:02]** board.

**[07:02]** board. So at the time I was hired to a

**[07:04]** So at the time I was hired to a

**[07:04]** So at the time I was hired to a conversational AI company working on a

**[07:06]** conversational AI company working on a

**[07:06]** conversational AI company working on a platform. Sorry, let me rephrase that.

**[07:08]** platform. Sorry, let me rephrase that.

**[07:08]** platform. Sorry, let me rephrase that. AI agent building platform. Just wanted

**[07:10]** AI agent building platform. Just wanted

**[07:10]** AI agent building platform. Just wanted to make sure you guys understood what

**[07:12]** to make sure you guys understood what

**[07:12]** to make sure you guys understood what that meant. And I was hired with the

**[07:14]** that meant. And I was hired with the

**[07:14]** that meant. And I was hired with the mandate of we want ML. That was my job

**[07:17]** mandate of we want ML. That was my job

**[07:17]** mandate of we want ML. That was my job description.

**[07:19]** description.

**[07:19]** description. Change that. We want AI.

**[07:21]** Change that. We want AI.

**[07:21]** Change that. We want AI. So after working with the business teams

**[07:23]** So after working with the business teams

**[07:23]** So after working with the business teams and leadership team, the this was the

**[07:25]** and leadership team, the this was the

**[07:25]** and leadership team, the this was the the final set of goals we set. We want

**[07:27]** the final set of goals we set. We want

**[07:27]** the final set of goals we set. We want to serve hundreds of thousands of

**[07:28]** to serve hundreds of thousands of

**[07:28]** to serve hundreds of thousands of concurrent models. It needs to be

**[07:29]** concurrent models. It needs to be

**[07:29]** concurrent models. It needs to be multi-dommain. It has to be low cost and

**[07:31]** multi-dommain. It has to be low cost and

**[07:31]** multi-dommain. It has to be low cost and we want to support real-time training

**[07:32]** we want to support real-time training

**[07:32]** we want to support real-time training and serving. Those are some tough goals.

**[07:36]** and serving. Those are some tough goals.

**[07:36]** and serving. Those are some tough goals. So this is what we did. Uh we wrote a

**[07:38]** So this is what we did. Uh we wrote a

**[07:38]** So this is what we did. Uh we wrote a custom MLOps platform for deployments to

**[07:41]** custom MLOps platform for deployments to

**[07:41]** custom MLOps platform for deployments to to match our requirements. We mainly

**[07:43]** to match our requirements. We mainly

**[07:43]** to match our requirements. We mainly fine-tuned encoder models. We built rag

**[07:45]** fine-tuned encoder models. We built rag

**[07:45]** fine-tuned encoder models. We built rag as a service and as a team we own six

**[07:47]** as a service and as a team we own six

**[07:47]** as a service and as a team we own six microservices on tend.

**[07:51]** microservices on tend.

**[07:51]** microservices on tend. So the three areas I focused on building

**[07:53]** So the three areas I focused on building

**[07:53]** So the three areas I focused on building the team was model training, model

**[07:55]** the team was model training, model

**[07:55]** the team was model training, model serving and business acumen. Now you

**[07:59]** serving and business acumen. Now you

**[07:59]** serving and business acumen. Now you might say I want top grades on all these


### [08:00 - 09:00]

**[08:01]** might say I want top grades on all these

**[08:01]** might say I want top grades on all these things but that's a lot of money right

**[08:03]** things but that's a lot of money right

**[08:03]** things but that's a lot of money right and as a as a team leader as somebody

**[08:06]** and as a as a team leader as somebody

**[08:06]** and as a as a team leader as somebody who manages a budget you don't have

**[08:07]** who manages a budget you don't have

**[08:07]** who manages a budget you don't have infinite money. So we have to pick along

**[08:10]** infinite money. So we have to pick along

**[08:10]** infinite money. So we have to pick along this axis where do we want each of these

**[08:12]** this axis where do we want each of these

**[08:12]** this axis where do we want each of these skills to lie for model training we we

**[08:15]** skills to lie for model training we we

**[08:15]** skills to lie for model training we we don't want somebody at the very bottom

**[08:17]** don't want somebody at the very bottom

**[08:17]** don't want somebody at the very bottom but we don't need somebody who can train

**[08:18]** but we don't need somebody who can train

**[08:18]** but we don't need somebody who can train GPT3 and basically we went across and

**[08:21]** GPT3 and basically we went across and

**[08:21]** GPT3 and basically we went across and said okay what are the key requirements

**[08:23]** said okay what are the key requirements

**[08:23]** said okay what are the key requirements for model training we said somebody in

**[08:25]** for model training we said somebody in

**[08:25]** for model training we said somebody in the the upper half who knows general

**[08:27]** the the upper half who knows general

**[08:27]** the the upper half who knows general architectures of models uh can do

**[08:29]** architectures of models uh can do

**[08:29]** architectures of models uh can do encoder fine-tuning does some data

**[08:31]** encoder fine-tuning does some data

**[08:31]** encoder fine-tuning does some data engineering using hugging face is okay

**[08:33]** engineering using hugging face is okay

**[08:33]** engineering using hugging face is okay that was the bar we set on the model

**[08:36]** that was the bar we set on the model

**[08:36]** that was the bar we set on the model serving perspective on the first round I

**[08:38]** serving perspective on the first round I

**[08:38]** serving perspective on the first round I was the first engineer at the company. I

**[08:39]** was the first engineer at the company. I

**[08:39]** was the first engineer at the company. I spent a lot of time on building the ML

**[08:41]** spent a lot of time on building the ML

**[08:41]** spent a lot of time on building the ML platform, but that was something I was

**[08:42]** platform, but that was something I was

**[08:42]** platform, but that was something I was comfortable with coming from a cloud

**[08:43]** comfortable with coming from a cloud

**[08:43]** comfortable with coming from a cloud engineering background. Now, after that,

**[08:45]** engineering background. Now, after that,

**[08:45]** engineering background. Now, after that, there was enough abstraction built in

**[08:47]** there was enough abstraction built in

**[08:47]** there was enough abstraction built in that we didn't need somebody who knew

**[08:48]** that we didn't need somebody who knew

**[08:48]** that we didn't need somebody who knew the intricacies of how Kubernetes worked

**[08:51]** the intricacies of how Kubernetes worked

**[08:51]** the intricacies of how Kubernetes worked and how we did serving or training, but

**[08:54]** and how we did serving or training, but

**[08:54]** and how we did serving or training, but the capability to use these abstractions

**[08:56]** the capability to use these abstractions

**[08:56]** the capability to use these abstractions and understand the trade-offs that were

**[08:58]** and understand the trade-offs that were

**[08:58]** and understand the trade-offs that were being made.


### [09:00 - 10:00]

**[09:00]** being made.

**[09:00]** being made. And where I did focus on is the ability

**[09:02]** And where I did focus on is the ability

**[09:02]** And where I did focus on is the ability of our engineers to get on calls with

**[09:04]** of our engineers to get on calls with

**[09:04]** of our engineers to get on calls with customers, right? We didn't need a

**[09:05]** customers, right? We didn't need a

**[09:05]** customers, right? We didn't need a business development rep who would just

**[09:07]** business development rep who would just

**[09:07]** business development rep who would just call cold call people for fun. Uh but we

**[09:09]** call cold call people for fun. Uh but we

**[09:09]** call cold call people for fun. Uh but we need engineers who didn't say my job is

**[09:12]** need engineers who didn't say my job is

**[09:12]** need engineers who didn't say my job is coding in a basement. Right? So we went

**[09:14]** coding in a basement. Right? So we went

**[09:14]** coding in a basement. Right? So we went through and understood these trade-offs

**[09:16]** through and understood these trade-offs

**[09:16]** through and understood these trade-offs that that needed to happen.

**[09:18]** that that needed to happen.

**[09:18]** that that needed to happen. Now in 2024 I was building another team

**[09:21]** Now in 2024 I was building another team

**[09:21]** Now in 2024 I was building another team uh the new organization that I joined

**[09:23]** uh the new organization that I joined

**[09:24]** uh the new organization that I joined and similar approach but open source had

**[09:26]** and similar approach but open source had

**[09:26]** and similar approach but open source had advanced. When I was building the

**[09:28]** advanced. When I was building the

**[09:28]** advanced. When I was building the original ML platform, we didn't have

**[09:29]** original ML platform, we didn't have

**[09:30]** original ML platform, we didn't have things like shadow deployments or AB

**[09:31]** things like shadow deployments or AB

**[09:31]** things like shadow deployments or AB testing in a lot of the platforms that

**[09:33]** testing in a lot of the platforms that

**[09:33]** testing in a lot of the platforms that existed and we had a specific use case.

**[09:36]** existed and we had a specific use case.

**[09:36]** existed and we had a specific use case. Now, since then, what's important to

**[09:38]** Now, since then, what's important to

**[09:38]** Now, since then, what's important to recognize is that all these skills that

**[09:40]** recognize is that all these skills that

**[09:40]** recognize is that all these skills that you're prioritizing don't necessarily

**[09:41]** you're prioritizing don't necessarily

**[09:42]** you're prioritizing don't necessarily need to be one person. They can be

**[09:43]** need to be one person. They can be

**[09:43]** need to be one person. They can be multiple people. You just have to find a

**[09:44]** multiple people. You just have to find a

**[09:44]** multiple people. You just have to find a way to make the team work. So, once

**[09:47]** way to make the team work. So, once

**[09:47]** way to make the team work. So, once again, we we set similar uh structures.

**[09:51]** again, we we set similar uh structures.

**[09:52]** again, we we set similar uh structures. And in this case because open source h

**[09:54]** And in this case because open source h

**[09:54]** And in this case because open source h had advanced uh in a number of different

**[09:56]** had advanced uh in a number of different

**[09:56]** had advanced uh in a number of different ways and commercial models had advanced

**[09:58]** ways and commercial models had advanced

**[09:58]** ways and commercial models had advanced some of the things shifted around on the


### [10:00 - 11:00]

**[10:00]** some of the things shifted around on the

**[10:00]** some of the things shifted around on the on the training side using commercial

**[10:02]** on the training side using commercial

**[10:02]** on the training side using commercial APIs and and prompt tuning and model

**[10:05]** APIs and and prompt tuning and model

**[10:05]** APIs and and prompt tuning and model fine-tuning commercial models became

**[10:07]** fine-tuning commercial models became

**[10:07]** fine-tuning commercial models became important but we also expanded our

**[10:09]** important but we also expanded our

**[10:09]** important but we also expanded our scope. We're now using decoder encoder

**[10:11]** scope. We're now using decoder encoder

**[10:11]** scope. We're now using decoder encoder models which each have their nuances. Uh

**[10:13]** models which each have their nuances. Uh

**[10:13]** models which each have their nuances. Uh on the serving side uh because we were

**[10:15]** on the serving side uh because we were

**[10:15]** on the serving side uh because we were using a open source offering we didn't

**[10:17]** using a open source offering we didn't

**[10:18]** using a open source offering we didn't need to write our own platform which is

**[10:19]** need to write our own platform which is

**[10:19]** need to write our own platform which is nice. And on the domain side again

**[10:22]** nice. And on the domain side again

**[10:22]** nice. And on the domain side again because of the nature of our business of

**[10:24]** because of the nature of our business of

**[10:24]** because of the nature of our business of doing medical record processing there's

**[10:26]** doing medical record processing there's

**[10:26]** doing medical record processing there's a whole nuance of what that domain

**[10:27]** a whole nuance of what that domain

**[10:27]** a whole nuance of what that domain knowledge was. So that bar increased in

**[10:30]** knowledge was. So that bar increased in

**[10:30]** knowledge was. So that bar increased in a different way.

**[10:33]** a different way.

**[10:33]** a different way. So now that we know what kind of skills

**[10:34]** So now that we know what kind of skills

**[10:34]** So now that we know what kind of skills we need for our team we can identify

**[10:36]** we need for our team we can identify

**[10:36]** we need for our team we can identify this threshold and balance the budget.

**[10:38]** this threshold and balance the budget.

**[10:38]** this threshold and balance the budget. Right? We can't just ask for infinite

**[10:39]** Right? We can't just ask for infinite

**[10:40]** Right? We can't just ask for infinite money unless you're a specific subset of

**[10:41]** money unless you're a specific subset of

**[10:41]** money unless you're a specific subset of companies.

**[10:43]** companies.

**[10:43]** companies. You might have this question. What if I

**[10:45]** You might have this question. What if I

**[10:45]** You might have this question. What if I already have a team? I have 40 people,

**[10:47]** already have a team? I have 40 people,

**[10:47]** already have a team? I have 40 people, 100 people. What do I do? How do I

**[10:49]** 100 people. What do I do? How do I

**[10:49]** 100 people. What do I do? How do I reskill, upskill? How do I manage this

**[10:52]** reskill, upskill? How do I manage this

**[10:52]** reskill, upskill? How do I manage this team? So, we need to figure out what the

**[10:54]** team? So, we need to figure out what the

**[10:54]** team? So, we need to figure out what the goal of the team is as we were referring

**[10:55]** goal of the team is as we were referring

**[10:55]** goal of the team is as we were referring to. And I typically like to think about

**[10:58]** to. And I typically like to think about

**[10:58]** to. And I typically like to think about it through inner and outer loops. So,


### [11:00 - 12:00]

**[11:00]** it through inner and outer loops. So,

**[11:00]** it through inner and outer loops. So, inner loops are the daily activities

**[11:02]** inner loops are the daily activities

**[11:02]** inner loops are the daily activities that the team needs to accomplish

**[11:03]** that the team needs to accomplish

**[11:03]** that the team needs to accomplish together every day uh to be successful.

**[11:06]** together every day uh to be successful.

**[11:06]** together every day uh to be successful. And the outer loop is the broader set of

**[11:08]** And the outer loop is the broader set of

**[11:08]** And the outer loop is the broader set of activities that will set you apart. And

**[11:10]** activities that will set you apart. And

**[11:10]** activities that will set you apart. And you might not need constant interaction

**[11:11]** you might not need constant interaction

**[11:11]** you might not need constant interaction with that, but they're really important.

**[11:14]** with that, but they're really important.

**[11:14]** with that, but they're really important. So, in my current team, this is how we

**[11:16]** So, in my current team, this is how we

**[11:16]** So, in my current team, this is how we typically structure it. Uh so we have

**[11:19]** typically structure it. Uh so we have

**[11:19]** typically structure it. Uh so we have model training, prompting, product

**[11:20]** model training, prompting, product

**[11:20]** model training, prompting, product requirements, model serving, some domain

**[11:22]** requirements, model serving, some domain

**[11:22]** requirements, model serving, some domain experts and the capability to build

**[11:24]** experts and the capability to build

**[11:24]** experts and the capability to build business cases as the core nucleus of

**[11:26]** business cases as the core nucleus of

**[11:26]** business cases as the core nucleus of our team. And again as you're building

**[11:28]** our team. And again as you're building

**[11:28]** our team. And again as you're building your team and your function within your

**[11:31]** your team and your function within your

**[11:31]** your team and your function within your domain, these will be different. But

**[11:32]** domain, these will be different. But

**[11:32]** domain, these will be different. But this is a framework to understand what

**[11:34]** this is a framework to understand what

**[11:34]** this is a framework to understand what are my priorities. Now we need to have

**[11:36]** are my priorities. Now we need to have

**[11:36]** are my priorities. Now we need to have the expertise in our outer loop as well

**[11:38]** the expertise in our outer loop as well

**[11:38]** the expertise in our outer loop as well to to further differentiate our company

**[11:40]** to to further differentiate our company

**[11:40]** to to further differentiate our company and our team.

**[11:42]** and our team.

**[11:42]** and our team. If you have a weak technical loop on the

**[11:44]** If you have a weak technical loop on the

**[11:44]** If you have a weak technical loop on the inside, you're going to struggle with

**[11:45]** inside, you're going to struggle with

**[11:46]** inside, you're going to struggle with the technical execution. If you have a

**[11:48]** the technical execution. If you have a

**[11:48]** the technical execution. If you have a weak domain loop, you're not going to

**[11:49]** weak domain loop, you're not going to

**[11:49]** weak domain loop, you're not going to find product market fit. So, you need to

**[11:51]** find product market fit. So, you need to

**[11:51]** find product market fit. So, you need to make sure that you really understand

**[11:53]** make sure that you really understand

**[11:53]** make sure that you really understand those feedback loops and the

**[11:54]** those feedback loops and the

**[11:54]** those feedback loops and the collaboration loops that exist within

**[11:55]** collaboration loops that exist within

**[11:55]** collaboration loops that exist within your company.

**[11:59]** your company.

**[11:59]** your company. Now, depending where you are at the


### [12:00 - 13:00]

**[12:00]** Now, depending where you are at the

**[12:00]** Now, depending where you are at the stage of your AI strategy, uh all of us

**[12:03]** stage of your AI strategy, uh all of us

**[12:03]** stage of your AI strategy, uh all of us fall on a different spectrum. You win

**[12:05]** fall on a different spectrum. You win

**[12:06]** fall on a different spectrum. You win with different types of people. You win

**[12:07]** with different types of people. You win

**[12:07]** with different types of people. You win with journalists at the beginning when

**[12:08]** with journalists at the beginning when

**[12:08]** with journalists at the beginning when you're trying to find that fit, trying

**[12:10]** you're trying to find that fit, trying

**[12:10]** you're trying to find that fit, trying to make that basic progress until you

**[12:12]** to make that basic progress until you

**[12:12]** to make that basic progress until you get to the point where you exhaust the

**[12:14]** get to the point where you exhaust the

**[12:14]** get to the point where you exhaust the knowledge and you need to move into a

**[12:15]** knowledge and you need to move into a

**[12:15]** knowledge and you need to move into a more specialist model. So once again on

**[12:18]** more specialist model. So once again on

**[12:18]** more specialist model. So once again on the general side, most companies as

**[12:20]** the general side, most companies as

**[12:20]** the general side, most companies as they're going through transformation

**[12:22]** they're going through transformation

**[12:22]** they're going through transformation fall in that category. Once you get to a

**[12:24]** fall in that category. Once you get to a

**[12:24]** fall in that category. Once you get to a really good stage for your model

**[12:25]** really good stage for your model

**[12:25]** really good stage for your model training, serving and so forth, you need

**[12:27]** training, serving and so forth, you need

**[12:27]** training, serving and so forth, you need specialists to push the extra 5% of

**[12:30]** specialists to push the extra 5% of

**[12:30]** specialists to push the extra 5% of performance there.

**[12:33]** performance there.

**[12:33]** performance there. So generally my perspective is

**[12:34]** So generally my perspective is

**[12:34]** So generally my perspective is generalists are good because they're

**[12:36]** generalists are good because they're

**[12:36]** generalists are good because they're adaptable. And in most cases, you're

**[12:38]** adaptable. And in most cases, you're

**[12:38]** adaptable. And in most cases, you're you're good enough with a general uh a

**[12:40]** you're good enough with a general uh a

**[12:40]** you're good enough with a general uh a generalist who can do many different

**[12:42]** generalist who can do many different

**[12:42]** generalist who can do many different things beyond just writing code.

**[12:46]** things beyond just writing code.

**[12:46]** things beyond just writing code. Let's talk about upskilling, reskilling,

**[12:48]** Let's talk about upskilling, reskilling,

**[12:48]** Let's talk about upskilling, reskilling, and hiring.

**[12:50]** and hiring.

**[12:50]** and hiring. So I think there are three main things

**[12:52]** So I think there are three main things

**[12:52]** So I think there are three main things as we continue go to go through this AI

**[12:53]** as we continue go to go through this AI

**[12:54]** as we continue go to go through this AI wave that you need to do. People need to

**[12:55]** wave that you need to do. People need to

**[12:55]** wave that you need to do. People need to learn to build. You need to become a

**[12:57]** learn to build. You need to become a

**[12:57]** learn to build. You need to become a domain expert. And you need to be human

**[13:59]** priorities of our team and our company.

**[13:59]** priorities of our team and our company. And we make sure that every week we're


### [14:00 - 15:00]

**[14:00]** And we make sure that every week we're

**[14:00]** And we make sure that every week we're upskilling ourselves. If this sounds

**[14:02]** upskilling ourselves. If this sounds

**[14:02]** upskilling ourselves. If this sounds intense, the consequences of not doing

**[14:04]** intense, the consequences of not doing

**[14:04]** intense, the consequences of not doing this are much higher.

**[14:06]** this are much higher.

**[14:06]** this are much higher. Let's close out on hiring. When do you

**[14:09]** Let's close out on hiring. When do you

**[14:09]** Let's close out on hiring. When do you need to hire? I believe that people need

**[14:12]** need to hire? I believe that people need

**[14:12]** need to hire? I believe that people need to be hired for two main reasons. One is

**[14:13]** to be hired for two main reasons. One is

**[14:14]** to be hired for two main reasons. One is to hold context and the other is to act

**[14:15]** to hold context and the other is to act

**[14:15]** to hold context and the other is to act on context. So it's important that if

**[14:18]** on context. So it's important that if

**[14:18]** on context. So it's important that if you have too few people on your team,

**[14:20]** you have too few people on your team,

**[14:20]** you have too few people on your team, things are getting dropped and you can't

**[14:21]** things are getting dropped and you can't

**[14:21]** things are getting dropped and you can't execute on your priorities.

**[14:23]** execute on your priorities.

**[14:24]** execute on your priorities. You might ask the question, can't AI

**[14:25]** You might ask the question, can't AI

**[14:25]** You might ask the question, can't AI agents with a massive context window do

**[14:27]** agents with a massive context window do

**[14:27]** agents with a massive context window do this? Maybe to some extent, but you need

**[14:30]** this? Maybe to some extent, but you need

**[14:30]** this? Maybe to some extent, but you need expertise to be able to verify that this

**[14:33]** expertise to be able to verify that this

**[14:33]** expertise to be able to verify that this context and this execution is correct.

**[14:35]** context and this execution is correct.

**[14:35]** context and this execution is correct. And to have expertise, you need to have

**[14:37]** And to have expertise, you need to have

**[14:37]** And to have expertise, you need to have context. And finally, humans should be

**[14:39]** context. And finally, humans should be

**[14:39]** context. And finally, humans should be accountable for the systems that we

**[14:40]** accountable for the systems that we

**[14:40]** accountable for the systems that we build. Uh, as we have in the old IBM

**[14:43]** build. Uh, as we have in the old IBM

**[14:43]** build. Uh, as we have in the old IBM quote, right? We can't hold a machine

**[14:45]** quote, right? We can't hold a machine

**[14:45]** quote, right? We can't hold a machine accountable.

**[14:47]** accountable.

**[14:50]** So, who do you who do you need to hire?

**[14:50]** So, who do you who do you need to hire? So, we're hiring on a budget. And going

**[14:53]** So, we're hiring on a budget. And going

**[14:53]** So, we're hiring on a budget. And going back to everything that we've talked

**[14:54]** back to everything that we've talked

**[14:54]** back to everything that we've talked about today, you need to know your team

**[14:55]** about today, you need to know your team

**[14:55]** about today, you need to know your team composition and the needs that you have

**[14:57]** composition and the needs that you have

**[14:57]** composition and the needs that you have to set up this budget, right? If you're

**[14:59]** to set up this budget, right? If you're

**[14:59]** to set up this budget, right? If you're trying to hire the top researcher, it's


### [15:00 - 16:00]

**[15:01]** trying to hire the top researcher, it's

**[15:01]** trying to hire the top researcher, it's going to be very expensive. If you're

**[15:02]** going to be very expensive. If you're

**[15:02]** going to be very expensive. If you're going to hire a generalist AI engineer,

**[15:04]** going to hire a generalist AI engineer,

**[15:04]** going to hire a generalist AI engineer, will be quite a bit cheaper.

**[15:07]** will be quite a bit cheaper.

**[15:07]** will be quite a bit cheaper. Now, it's also important when you're

**[15:08]** Now, it's also important when you're

**[15:08]** Now, it's also important when you're hiring is that you're not just following

**[15:09]** hiring is that you're not just following

**[15:10]** hiring is that you're not just following trends. Who here has heard the trend

**[15:11]** trends. Who here has heard the trend

**[15:11]** trends. Who here has heard the trend that junior engineers shouldn't be hired

**[15:13]** that junior engineers shouldn't be hired

**[15:13]** that junior engineers shouldn't be hired or just using AI agents?

**[15:16]** or just using AI agents?

**[15:16]** or just using AI agents? Okay, some people are asleep.

**[15:25]** Now, the counterpoint here is why is YC

**[15:25]** Now, the counterpoint here is why is YC running a a school an AI school for

**[15:28]** running a a school an AI school for

**[15:28]** running a a school an AI school for students and young people on AI? 2,000

**[15:30]** students and young people on AI? 2,000

**[15:30]** students and young people on AI? 2,000 people coming to to San Francisco in two

**[15:32]** people coming to to San Francisco in two

**[15:32]** people coming to to San Francisco in two weeks. Why are they doing that?

**[15:34]** weeks. Why are they doing that?

**[15:34]** weeks. Why are they doing that? Certainly entrylevel positions if they

**[15:36]** Certainly entrylevel positions if they

**[15:36]** Certainly entrylevel positions if they were useless they wouldn't be bringing

**[15:38]** were useless they wouldn't be bringing

**[15:38]** were useless they wouldn't be bringing in all all these young people. So make

**[15:40]** in all all these young people. So make

**[15:40]** in all all these young people. So make sure that you verify the trends that

**[15:41]** sure that you verify the trends that

**[15:41]** sure that you verify the trends that you're seeing and uh think from first

**[15:44]** you're seeing and uh think from first

**[15:44]** you're seeing and uh think from first principles. What do I need? What is the

**[15:45]** principles. What do I need? What is the

**[15:45]** principles. What do I need? What is the team composition? Is it new grads? Is it

**[15:48]** team composition? Is it new grads? Is it

**[15:48]** team composition? Is it new grads? Is it people with 30 years of experience? Is

**[15:50]** people with 30 years of experience? Is

**[15:50]** people with 30 years of experience? Is what are the retraining opportunities,

**[15:52]** what are the retraining opportunities,

**[15:52]** what are the retraining opportunities, right? Uh there's lots of ways to to

**[15:54]** right? Uh there's lots of ways to to

**[15:54]** right? Uh there's lots of ways to to build a great team.

**[15:57]** build a great team.

**[15:57]** build a great team. Now just repeating this because I've

**[15:59]** Now just repeating this because I've

**[15:59]** Now just repeating this because I've seen so many companies do this. Ask


### [16:00 - 17:00]

**[16:01]** seen so many companies do this. Ask

**[16:01]** seen so many companies do this. Ask relevant questions to the job. stop

**[16:03]** relevant questions to the job. stop

**[16:03]** relevant questions to the job. stop putting people through lead codes that

**[16:05]** putting people through lead codes that

**[16:05]** putting people through lead codes that have nothing to do with the job. Uh and

**[16:07]** have nothing to do with the job. Uh and

**[16:07]** have nothing to do with the job. Uh and now that LMS can solve it, it's not a

**[16:09]** now that LMS can solve it, it's not a

**[16:09]** now that LMS can solve it, it's not a great way to evaluate either.

**[16:11]** great way to evaluate either.

**[16:12]** great way to evaluate either. So we go back to Ampear's wager. Uh you

**[16:14]** So we go back to Ampear's wager. Uh you

**[16:14]** So we go back to Ampear's wager. Uh you have the question of am I going to have

**[16:17]** have the question of am I going to have

**[16:17]** have the question of am I going to have five researchers from the top labs or am

**[16:20]** five researchers from the top labs or am

**[16:20]** five researchers from the top labs or am I going to build my team in a domain

**[16:22]** I going to build my team in a domain

**[16:22]** I going to build my team in a domain specific way. So, for example, in my

**[16:25]** specific way. So, for example, in my

**[16:25]** specific way. So, for example, in my company, I'd rather have the team on the

**[16:26]** company, I'd rather have the team on the

**[16:26]** company, I'd rather have the team on the left with the domain expertise, the

**[16:28]** left with the domain expertise, the

**[16:28]** left with the domain expertise, the ability to sell, work, have empathy with

**[16:30]** ability to sell, work, have empathy with

**[16:30]** ability to sell, work, have empathy with customers rather than just having five

**[16:32]** customers rather than just having five

**[16:32]** customers rather than just having five researchers. That's the way that our

**[16:34]** researchers. That's the way that our

**[16:34]** researchers. That's the way that our domain and company are structured.

**[16:37]** domain and company are structured.

**[16:37]** domain and company are structured. Now, you can also answer Blackwell's

**[16:39]** Now, you can also answer Blackwell's

**[16:39]** Now, you can also answer Blackwell's wager, which is do you want GPUs or a

**[16:41]** wager, which is do you want GPUs or a

**[16:41]** wager, which is do you want GPUs or a team? Uh, so that's a story for another

**[16:44]** team? Uh, so that's a story for another

**[16:44]** team? Uh, so that's a story for another day.

**[16:46]** day.

**[16:46]** day. So, overall, we have three main lessons

**[16:48]** So, overall, we have three main lessons

**[16:48]** So, overall, we have three main lessons from today. The first one is it's

**[16:50]** from today. The first one is it's

**[16:50]** from today. The first one is it's important to start off from the

**[16:51]** important to start off from the

**[16:51]** important to start off from the beginning and say what do what team do

**[16:53]** beginning and say what do what team do

**[16:53]** beginning and say what do what team do you need to win? Once you know that

**[16:55]** you need to win? Once you know that

**[16:56]** you need to win? Once you know that you'll start noticing that cross

**[16:57]** you'll start noticing that cross

**[16:57]** you'll start noticing that cross functional teams will continue to be

**[16:58]** functional teams will continue to be

**[16:58]** functional teams will continue to be effective but they'll be built in


### [17:00 - 18:00]

**[17:00]** effective but they'll be built in

**[17:00]** effective but they'll be built in different ways. The overlap will be

**[17:02]** different ways. The overlap will be

**[17:02]** different ways. The overlap will be greater but all of us will have the

**[17:03]** greater but all of us will have the

**[17:03]** greater but all of us will have the opportunity to work with AI systems and

**[17:05]** opportunity to work with AI systems and

**[17:05]** opportunity to work with AI systems and contribute to our product. And finally

**[17:07]** contribute to our product. And finally

**[17:07]** contribute to our product. And finally we need to continue learning. This is a

**[17:10]** we need to continue learning. This is a

**[17:10]** we need to continue learning. This is a must right the world moves too quickly.

**[17:13]** must right the world moves too quickly.

**[17:13]** must right the world moves too quickly. We we have Pelican evaluations now for

**[17:16]** We we have Pelican evaluations now for

**[17:16]** We we have Pelican evaluations now for the past six months rather than the past

**[17:17]** the past six months rather than the past

**[17:17]** the past six months rather than the past year, right? Hopefully that's an

**[17:19]** year, right? Hopefully that's an

**[17:19]** year, right? Hopefully that's an illustration of how fast the world works

**[17:21]** illustration of how fast the world works
