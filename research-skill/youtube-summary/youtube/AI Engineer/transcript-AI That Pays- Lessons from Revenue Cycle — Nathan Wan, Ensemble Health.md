**[00:17]** So great to be here today. U excited to

**[00:17]** So great to be here today. U excited to talk to you about a little bit of the

**[00:19]** talk to you about a little bit of the

**[00:19]** talk to you about a little bit of the healthare system that often gets

**[00:20]** healthare system that often gets

**[00:20]** healthare system that often gets overlooked. It's part of the healthare

**[00:22]** overlooked. It's part of the healthare

**[00:22]** overlooked. It's part of the healthare system. A system that actually continues

**[00:23]** system. A system that actually continues

**[00:23]** system. A system that actually continues to grow in multiple dimensions. Over the

**[00:26]** to grow in multiple dimensions. Over the

**[00:26]** to grow in multiple dimensions. Over the past couple of decades, its size, cost,

**[00:28]** past couple of decades, its size, cost,

**[00:28]** past couple of decades, its size, cost, and complexity outpace many other

**[00:30]** and complexity outpace many other

**[00:30]** and complexity outpace many other benchmarks. That's because right now 40%

**[00:33]** benchmarks. That's because right now 40%

**[00:33]** benchmarks. That's because right now 40% of hospitals operate at a negative

**[00:34]** of hospitals operate at a negative

**[00:34]** of hospitals operate at a negative margin.

**[00:36]** margin.

**[00:36]** margin. Let me put it another way. Almost half

**[00:38]** Let me put it another way. Almost half

**[00:38]** Let me put it another way. Almost half the hospitals in the country are losing

**[00:39]** the hospitals in the country are losing

**[00:39]** the hospitals in the country are losing money. It's uh and it's not because of

**[00:42]** money. It's uh and it's not because of

**[00:42]** money. It's uh and it's not because of the clinical costs. It's because of the

**[00:44]** the clinical costs. It's because of the

**[00:44]** the clinical costs. It's because of the broken and manual processes around the

**[00:46]** broken and manual processes around the

**[00:46]** broken and manual processes around the revenue cycle. There's delays, denials,

**[00:49]** revenue cycle. There's delays, denials,

**[00:49]** revenue cycle. There's delays, denials, a lot of rework, a lot of lost revenue.

**[00:52]** a lot of rework, a lot of lost revenue.

**[00:52]** a lot of rework, a lot of lost revenue. My name is Nathan. I'm the head of AI at

**[00:54]** My name is Nathan. I'm the head of AI at Ensemble Health Partners and we work

**[00:56]** Ensemble Health Partners and we work

**[00:56]** Ensemble Health Partners and we work with hundreds of hospitals and health

**[00:57]** with hundreds of hospitals and health

**[00:57]** with hundreds of hospitals and health systems in the US to manage the revenue

**[00:59]** systems in the US to manage the revenue


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:00]** systems in the US to manage the revenue cycle. We're about 14,000 people and

**[01:03]** cycle. We're about 14,000 people and

**[01:28]** Revenue cycle management or RCM refers

**[01:28]** Revenue cycle management or RCM refers to the financial process uh of the

**[01:31]** to the financial process uh of the

**[01:31]** to the financial process uh of the patient's journey uh within the

**[01:33]** patient's journey uh within the

**[01:33]** patient's journey uh within the healthcare system

**[01:35]** healthcare system

**[01:35]** healthcare system and it's traditionally thought of as a

**[01:37]** and it's traditionally thought of as a series of steps uh that go that goes

**[01:39]** series of steps uh that go that goes

**[01:39]** series of steps uh that go that goes from one to the next

**[01:43]** from one to the next

**[01:43]** from one to the next and just a little bit about how I I got

**[01:44]** and just a little bit about how I I got

**[01:44]** and just a little bit about how I I got here. Uh I started my career in tech

**[01:47]** here. Uh I started my career in tech

**[01:47]** here. Uh I started my career in tech working at Google building operational

**[01:49]** working at Google building operational

**[01:49]** working at Google building operational software for operational teams and then

**[01:51]** software for operational teams and then

**[01:51]** software for operational teams and then working on speech recognition and

**[01:53]** working on speech recognition and

**[01:53]** working on speech recognition and language modeling.

**[01:55]** language modeling.

**[01:55]** language modeling. Back in my day which is now like over 10

**[01:57]** Back in my day which is now like over 10

**[01:57]** Back in my day which is now like over 10 years ago we were comparing language

**[01:58]** years ago we were comparing language

**[01:58]** years ago we were comparing language models that took you know traditional


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:00]** models that took you know traditional

**[02:00]** models that took you know traditional models with Google scale data and

**[02:02]** models with Google scale data and

**[02:02]** models with Google scale data and compared them to deep learning models

**[02:04]** compared them to deep learning models

**[02:04]** compared them to deep learning models trying to make them compete with each

**[02:05]** trying to make them compete with each

**[02:05]** trying to make them compete with each other and see which one worked better.

**[02:08]** other and see which one worked better.

**[02:08]** other and see which one worked better. But one of the really interesting

**[02:09]** But one of the really interesting

**[02:09]** But one of the really interesting projects that we worked on was called

**[02:10]** projects that we worked on was called

**[02:10]** projects that we worked on was called what is now called ambient. Um this is

**[02:12]** what is now called ambient. Um this is

**[02:12]** what is now called ambient. Um this is one of the things that um where people

**[02:14]** one of the things that um where people

**[02:14]** one of the things that um where people are trying to use the technology to

**[02:17]** are trying to use the technology to

**[02:17]** are trying to use the technology to improve the

**[02:20]** improve the

**[02:20]** improve the administrative burden for um for for for

**[02:23]** administrative burden for um for for for

**[02:23]** administrative burden for um for for for doctors.

**[02:25]** doctors.

**[02:25]** doctors. Um that's because oftent times doctors

**[02:27]** Um that's because oftent times doctors

**[02:27]** Um that's because oftent times doctors will spend hours after they see a

**[02:29]** will spend hours after they see a

**[02:29]** will spend hours after they see a patient writing, documenting and

**[02:31]** patient writing, documenting and

**[02:31]** patient writing, documenting and creating notes for themselves.

**[02:33]** creating notes for themselves.

**[02:33]** creating notes for themselves. Um while we weren't successful back back

**[02:36]** Um while we weren't successful back back

**[02:36]** Um while we weren't successful back back then uh today there's multiple projects

**[02:39]** then uh today there's multiple projects

**[02:39]** then uh today there's multiple projects and multiple uh multiple groups

**[02:42]** and multiple uh multiple groups

**[02:42]** and multiple uh multiple groups launching this uh and making it

**[02:44]** launching this uh and making it

**[02:44]** launching this uh and making it commercially viable and so it's been

**[02:46]** commercially viable and so it's been

**[02:46]** commercially viable and so it's been really successful and really exciting to

**[02:47]** really successful and really exciting to

**[02:47]** really successful and really exciting to see that change.

**[02:56]** Then I spent a little time uh in the

**[02:56]** Then I spent a little time uh in the world of startups in the world of

**[02:57]** world of startups in the world of

**[02:57]** world of startups in the world of biotech. uh I changed both the scale and


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:01]** biotech. uh I changed both the scale and

**[03:01]** biotech. uh I changed both the scale and the domain that I worked in and it was

**[03:03]** the domain that I worked in and it was

**[03:03]** the domain that I worked in and it was very exciting. I was really excited to

**[03:04]** very exciting. I was really excited to

**[03:04]** very exciting. I was really excited to work on a very strong mission a really

**[03:07]** work on a very strong mission a really

**[03:07]** work on a very strong mission a really exciting mission where we had a a big

**[03:09]** exciting mission where we had a a big

**[03:09]** exciting mission where we had a a big opportunity to make a big impact. I

**[03:11]** opportunity to make a big impact. I

**[03:11]** opportunity to make a big impact. I started first in diagnostics. Uh this is

**[03:13]** started first in diagnostics. Uh this is

**[03:13]** started first in diagnostics. Uh this is where I built models uh that and and

**[03:15]** where I built models uh that and and

**[03:15]** where I built models uh that and and built teams to detect cancer from blood.

**[03:18]** built teams to detect cancer from blood.

**[03:18]** built teams to detect cancer from blood. Um the goal was to give early insight

**[03:20]** Um the goal was to give early insight

**[03:20]** Um the goal was to give early insight into whether or not a patient had cancer

**[03:23]** into whether or not a patient had cancer

**[03:23]** into whether or not a patient had cancer or not. And we use machine learning to

**[03:25]** or not. And we use machine learning to

**[03:25]** or not. And we use machine learning to look at the blood and look for

**[03:27]** look at the blood and look for

**[03:27]** look at the blood and look for biomarkers and look across multiple data

**[03:29]** biomarkers and look across multiple data

**[03:29]** biomarkers and look across multiple data sets and patients to identify you know

**[03:31]** sets and patients to identify you know

**[03:31]** sets and patients to identify you know where might be the signal for cancer.

**[03:34]** where might be the signal for cancer.

**[03:34]** where might be the signal for cancer. After spending some time there I and

**[03:37]** After spending some time there I and

**[03:37]** After spending some time there I and seen the company grow from 30 people to

**[03:39]** seen the company grow from 30 people to

**[03:39]** seen the company grow from 30 people to over 300 people. I ended up at a even

**[03:42]** over 300 people. I ended up at a even

**[03:42]** over 300 people. I ended up at a even smaller therapeutic startup. uh we

**[03:44]** smaller therapeutic startup. uh we

**[03:44]** smaller therapeutic startup. uh we worked on novel data sets looking for

**[03:46]** worked on novel data sets looking for

**[03:46]** worked on novel data sets looking for unique interactions in complex

**[03:48]** unique interactions in complex

**[03:48]** unique interactions in complex microbiome communities to try to

**[03:49]** microbiome communities to try to

**[03:50]** microbiome communities to try to identify compounds that could be unique

**[03:52]** identify compounds that could be unique

**[03:52]** identify compounds that could be unique and uh really valuable in uh drug

**[03:55]** and uh really valuable in uh drug

**[03:55]** and uh really valuable in uh drug discovery

**[03:57]** discovery

**[03:57]** discovery and that's the thing when most people

**[03:58]** and that's the thing when most people

**[03:58]** and that's the thing when most people think about AI in healthcare these are


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:00]** think about AI in healthcare these are

**[04:00]** think about AI in healthcare these are these are the things that most people

**[04:01]** these are the things that most people

**[04:01]** these are the things that most people think of right there's diagnostics

**[04:03]** think of right there's diagnostics

**[04:03]** think of right there's diagnostics there's imaging there's other ways to

**[04:06]** there's imaging there's other ways to

**[04:06]** there's imaging there's other ways to improve uh documentation

**[04:09]** improve uh documentation

**[04:09]** improve uh documentation and uh decision-m for clinicians and

**[04:11]** and uh decision-m for clinicians and

**[04:11]** and uh decision-m for clinicians and drug discovery and these really

**[04:13]** drug discovery and these really

**[04:13]** drug discovery and these really impactful and really important problems.

**[04:15]** impactful and really important problems.

**[04:15]** impactful and really important problems. Uh, you know, I I I really enjoyed

**[04:17]** Uh, you know, I I I really enjoyed

**[04:17]** Uh, you know, I I I really enjoyed working on them and but there are some

**[04:18]** working on them and but there are some

**[04:18]** working on them and but there are some of the toughest and hardest to solve.

**[04:21]** of the toughest and hardest to solve.

**[04:21]** of the toughest and hardest to solve. Um, but that's also because some of the

**[04:23]** Um, but that's also because some of the

**[04:23]** Um, but that's also because some of the benefits are going to be massive as we

**[04:25]** benefits are going to be massive as we

**[04:25]** benefits are going to be massive as we continue to see groups and organization

**[04:27]** continue to see groups and organization

**[04:27]** continue to see groups and organization crack parts of it and make make headway.

**[04:29]** crack parts of it and make make headway.

**[04:29]** crack parts of it and make make headway. Um, we're seeing a lot of change

**[04:30]** Um, we're seeing a lot of change

**[04:30]** Um, we're seeing a lot of change already. But there is another part of

**[04:33]** already. But there is another part of

**[04:33]** already. But there is another part of the system, the healthare system that's

**[04:35]** the system, the healthare system that's

**[04:35]** the system, the healthare system that's not nearly as flashy, not doesn't nearly

**[04:38]** not nearly as flashy, not doesn't nearly

**[04:38]** not nearly as flashy, not doesn't nearly have the same attention on research or

**[04:40]** have the same attention on research or

**[04:40]** have the same attention on research or in media. Um that uh that also has a

**[04:44]** in media. Um that uh that also has a

**[04:44]** in media. Um that uh that also has a huge measurable real impact and is also

**[04:47]** huge measurable real impact and is also

**[04:47]** huge measurable real impact and is also ripe for AI disruption.

**[04:50]** ripe for AI disruption.

**[04:50]** ripe for AI disruption. And that's the healthare the financial

**[04:52]** And that's the healthare the financial

**[04:52]** And that's the healthare the financial side of healthcare. Uh right now we

**[04:54]** side of healthcare. Uh right now we

**[04:54]** side of healthcare. Uh right now we estimate that 20% of the GDP uh is uh is

**[04:58]** estimate that 20% of the GDP uh is uh is

**[04:58]** estimate that 20% of the GDP uh is uh is is attributed to the healthare system. A


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:01]** is attributed to the healthare system. A

**[05:01]** is attributed to the healthare system. A large proportion of that is the

**[05:03]** large proportion of that is the

**[05:03]** large proportion of that is the administration of healthcare.

**[05:05]** administration of healthcare.

**[05:05]** administration of healthcare. Uh this is billing, insurance related

**[05:08]** Uh this is billing, insurance related

**[05:08]** Uh this is billing, insurance related things, but it starts from like the very

**[05:10]** things, but it starts from like the very

**[05:10]** things, but it starts from like the very beginning through to the very end of the

**[05:12]** beginning through to the very end of the

**[05:12]** beginning through to the very end of the patient's journey uh with any healthcare

**[05:15]** patient's journey uh with any healthcare

**[05:15]** patient's journey uh with any healthcare provider starting with eligibility

**[05:16]** provider starting with eligibility

**[05:16]** provider starting with eligibility checks, registration, there's

**[05:18]** checks, registration, there's

**[05:18]** checks, registration, there's documentation, medical coding, denial

**[05:21]** documentation, medical coding, denial

**[05:21]** documentation, medical coding, denial management, so on and so forth.

**[05:25]** management, so on and so forth.

**[05:25]** management, so on and so forth. Um often times these aren't things that

**[05:27]** Um often times these aren't things that

**[05:27]** Um often times these aren't things that you'll see when you visit a PA doctor's

**[05:29]** you'll see when you visit a PA doctor's

**[05:29]** you'll see when you visit a PA doctor's office. uh not unless you're you

**[05:31]** office. uh not unless you're you

**[05:31]** office. uh not unless you're you encounter like a really challenging

**[05:32]** encounter like a really challenging

**[05:32]** encounter like a really challenging situation or you lack coverage or um you

**[05:36]** situation or you lack coverage or um you

**[05:36]** situation or you lack coverage or um you face some complication with with your

**[05:38]** face some complication with with your

**[05:38]** face some complication with with your care. Um but this process is very

**[05:41]** care. Um but this process is very

**[05:41]** care. Um but this process is very complex because it is very manual. It is

**[05:43]** complex because it is very manual. It is

**[05:43]** complex because it is very manual. It is very rules driven and very inconsistent.

**[05:46]** very rules driven and very inconsistent.

**[05:46]** very rules driven and very inconsistent. Um and in over the past three decades uh

**[05:49]** Um and in over the past three decades uh

**[05:49]** Um and in over the past three decades uh this healthcare administration in

**[05:51]** this healthcare administration in

**[05:51]** this healthcare administration in general has the number of people working

**[05:53]** general has the number of people working

**[05:53]** general has the number of people working in healthcare administration has

**[05:54]** in healthcare administration has

**[05:54]** in healthcare administration has increased 30fold. Um but in the same

**[05:57]** increased 30fold. Um but in the same

**[05:57]** increased 30fold. Um but in the same time period the number of clinicians

**[05:59]** time period the number of clinicians

**[05:59]** time period the number of clinicians clinic clinicians excuse me has barely


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:01]** clinic clinicians excuse me has barely

**[06:01]** clinic clinicians excuse me has barely doubled. So it just goes to show how

**[06:04]** doubled. So it just goes to show how

**[06:04]** doubled. So it just goes to show how much faster how much more complex how

**[06:06]** much faster how much more complex how

**[06:06]** much faster how much more complex how much how how much how much more quickly

**[06:08]** much how how much how much more quickly

**[06:08]** much how how much how much more quickly this area grows compared to the clinical

**[06:10]** this area grows compared to the clinical

**[06:10]** this area grows compared to the clinical side of healthcare. And just another

**[06:12]** side of healthcare. And just another

**[06:12]** side of healthcare. And just another note about terminology I'll keep using

**[06:15]** note about terminology I'll keep using

**[06:15]** note about terminology I'll keep using these words patients providers and

**[06:16]** these words patients providers and

**[06:16]** these words patients providers and payers. Patients I think we all can

**[06:19]** payers. Patients I think we all can

**[06:19]** payers. Patients I think we all can understand those are the people who

**[06:20]** understand those are the people who

**[06:20]** understand those are the people who receive care and providers are the ones

**[06:22]** receive care and providers are the ones

**[06:22]** receive care and providers are the ones who deliver it. people like the

**[06:24]** who deliver it. people like the

**[06:24]** who deliver it. people like the hospitals, the specialty offices, the

**[06:26]** hospitals, the specialty offices, the

**[06:26]** hospitals, the specialty offices, the specialists, nurses and doctors that

**[06:29]** specialists, nurses and doctors that

**[06:29]** specialists, nurses and doctors that actually conduct and provide care

**[06:31]** actually conduct and provide care

**[06:31]** actually conduct and provide care medical care to the patients. And then

**[06:33]** medical care to the patients. And then

**[06:33]** medical care to the patients. And then payers are are those who provide the

**[06:35]** payers are are those who provide the

**[06:35]** payers are are those who provide the funding. So largely insurance companies,

**[06:37]** funding. So largely insurance companies,

**[06:37]** funding. So largely insurance companies, which would be private payers, but also

**[06:39]** which would be private payers, but also

**[06:39]** which would be private payers, but also other government institutions like

**[06:41]** other government institutions like

**[06:41]** other government institutions like Medicare and Medicaid.

**[06:48]** And just to make um and just to help

**[06:48]** And just to make um and just to help make that more concrete, right, the the

**[06:50]** make that more concrete, right, the the

**[06:50]** make that more concrete, right, the the the cost and complexity of healthcare is

**[06:52]** the cost and complexity of healthcare is

**[06:52]** the cost and complexity of healthcare is really related uh is really correlated,

**[06:56]** really related uh is really correlated,

**[06:56]** really related uh is really correlated, we estimate a large amount of the the

**[06:58]** we estimate a large amount of the the

**[06:58]** we estimate a large amount of the the cost associated with healthcare is


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:00]** cost associated with healthcare is

**[07:00]** cost associated with healthcare is actually related to friction. And in his

**[07:02]** actually related to friction. And in his

**[07:02]** actually related to friction. And in his case, friction means the inefficiencies

**[07:04]** case, friction means the inefficiencies

**[07:04]** case, friction means the inefficiencies around communicating back and forth

**[07:06]** around communicating back and forth

**[07:06]** around communicating back and forth between payers and providers and

**[07:08]** between payers and providers and

**[07:08]** between payers and providers and patients. And often a lot of that

**[07:10]** patients. And often a lot of that

**[07:10]** patients. And often a lot of that actually results in um uh in the same

**[07:14]** actually results in um uh in the same

**[07:14]** actually results in um uh in the same situ same outcome, right? Either the

**[07:15]** situ same outcome, right? Either the

**[07:15]** situ same outcome, right? Either the claim gets paid or it doesn't get paid.

**[07:18]** claim gets paid or it doesn't get paid.

**[07:18]** claim gets paid or it doesn't get paid. Uh one of the things we'll talk about is

**[07:20]** Uh one of the things we'll talk about is

**[07:20]** Uh one of the things we'll talk about is denials because that's one of the

**[07:21]** denials because that's one of the

**[07:21]** denials because that's one of the biggest components of friction. And

**[07:23]** biggest components of friction. And

**[10:30]** challenging because it's often not clear

**[10:30]** challenging because it's often not clear when a prior author is required. You

**[10:32]** when a prior author is required. You

**[10:34]** sometimes have to go to the payer portal

**[10:34]** sometimes have to go to the payer portal and say you know is this procedure um is

**[15:05]** terms of the overturn rate. How often are we seeing uh uh appeals being over

**[15:08]** are we seeing uh uh appeals being over

**[15:08]** are we seeing uh uh appeals being over denials being overturned and we have

**[15:11]** denials being overturned and we have

**[15:11]** denials being overturned and we have also seen the as a result the volume

**[15:14]** also seen the as a result the volume

**[15:14]** also seen the as a result the volume grow. But one thing I really want to

**[15:15]** grow. But one thing I really want to

**[15:15]** grow. But one thing I really want to point out here is that as as part of

**[15:17]** point out here is that as as part of

**[15:17]** point out here is that as as part of this operational and service team, we're

**[15:19]** this operational and service team, we're

**[15:19]** this operational and service team, we're able to really measure the the ROI

**[15:21]** able to really measure the the ROI

**[15:22]** able to really measure the the ROI directly. It's not just like a hand wavy

**[15:24]** directly. It's not just like a hand wavy

**[15:24]** directly. It's not just like a hand wavy this is value. We're tracking it very

**[15:26]** this is value. We're tracking it very

**[15:26]** this is value. We're tracking it very specifically and measuring it um uh very

**[15:29]** specifically and measuring it um uh very

**[15:29]** specifically and measuring it um uh very concretely. And that's one of the really

**[15:32]** concretely. And that's one of the really

**[15:32]** concretely. And that's one of the really exciting things about uh bringing

**[15:34]** exciting things about uh bringing

**[15:34]** exciting things about uh bringing bringing uh bringing AI to this RCM

**[15:37]** bringing uh bringing AI to this RCM

**[15:37]** bringing uh bringing AI to this RCM process.

**[15:39]** process.

**[15:39]** process. So I know AI won't I won't propo I won't

**[15:42]** So I know AI won't I won't propo I won't

**[15:42]** So I know AI won't I won't propo I won't purport to say that AI will be able to

**[15:44]** purport to say that AI will be able to

**[15:44]** purport to say that AI will be able to solve all of the problems overnight.

**[15:46]** solve all of the problems overnight.

**[15:46]** solve all of the problems overnight. This is an industry that's been reliant

**[15:48]** This is an industry that's been reliant

**[15:48]** This is an industry that's been reliant on a lot of processes um for a long

**[15:50]** on a lot of processes um for a long

**[15:50]** on a lot of processes um for a long time. You know, as I said, there's lots

**[15:52]** time. You know, as I said, there's lots

**[15:52]** time. You know, as I said, there's lots of rules. They're inconsistent. It's

**[15:54]** of rules. They're inconsistent. It's

**[15:54]** of rules. They're inconsistent. It's unstructured. Um you'll see data

**[15:56]** unstructured. Um you'll see data

**[15:56]** unstructured. Um you'll see data scattered across a wide range of

**[15:58]** scattered across a wide range of

**[15:58]** scattered across a wide range of systems. And this is one of the things

**[15:59]** systems. And this is one of the things


### [16:00 - 17:00]

**[16:00]** systems. And this is one of the things that makes it really challenging to to

**[16:02]** that makes it really challenging to to

**[16:02]** that makes it really challenging to to bring together as a cohesive or um and

**[16:05]** bring together as a cohesive or um and

**[16:05]** bring together as a cohesive or um and and unified process. Um Ensemble has

**[16:08]** and unified process. Um Ensemble has

**[16:08]** and unified process. Um Ensemble has spent invested a long a lot of uh uh a

**[16:12]** spent invested a long a lot of uh uh a

**[16:12]** spent invested a long a lot of uh uh a lot already in building up a single

**[16:14]** lot already in building up a single consistent uh infrastructure to be able

**[16:16]** consistent uh infrastructure to be able

**[16:16]** consistent uh infrastructure to be able to do this. And one of the reasons we

**[16:17]** to do this. And one of the reasons we

**[16:17]** to do this. And one of the reasons we have been successful has been because of

**[16:19]** have been successful has been because of

**[16:19]** have been successful has been because of the the platform that we call EIQ where

**[16:21]** the the platform that we call EIQ where

**[16:21]** the the platform that we call EIQ where we bring together multiple formats,

**[16:24]** we bring together multiple formats,

**[16:24]** we bring together multiple formats, multiple data formats um within within a

**[16:26]** multiple data formats um within within a

**[16:26]** multiple data formats um within within a single platform. Um, but obviously

**[16:28]** single platform. Um, but obviously

**[16:28]** single platform. Um, but obviously there's uh still great opportunity to to

**[16:31]** there's uh still great opportunity to to

**[16:31]** there's uh still great opportunity to to be able to do that. You'll see that EMRs

**[16:33]** be able to do that. You'll see that EMRs

**[16:33]** be able to do that. You'll see that EMRs have many different format types and it

**[16:36]** have many different format types and it

**[16:36]** have many different format types and it will challenge any uh multimodal LLM to

**[16:39]** will challenge any uh multimodal LLM to

**[16:39]** will challenge any uh multimodal LLM to to parse correctly.

**[16:42]** to parse correctly.

**[16:42]** to parse correctly. We're excited because we already see AI

**[16:44]** We're excited because we already see AI

**[16:44]** We're excited because we already see AI deliver value as you saw with the

**[16:46]** deliver value as you saw with the

**[16:46]** deliver value as you saw with the clinopial case. Um, but also uh in the

**[16:49]** clinopial case. Um, but also uh in the

**[16:49]** clinopial case. Um, but also uh in the prior authorization case, we're built

**[16:51]** prior authorization case, we're built

**[16:51]** prior authorization case, we're built continuing to build agents for all

**[16:53]** continuing to build agents for all

**[16:53]** continuing to build agents for all aspects of the revenue cycle process.

**[16:55]** aspects of the revenue cycle process.

**[16:55]** aspects of the revenue cycle process. But we know automation alone isn't going

**[16:57]** But we know automation alone isn't going

**[16:57]** But we know automation alone isn't going to be enough. There's complexity and

**[16:59]** to be enough. There's complexity and

**[16:59]** to be enough. There's complexity and revenue cycle. Uh that you know clicking


### [17:00 - 18:00]

**[17:02]** revenue cycle. Uh that you know clicking

**[17:02]** revenue cycle. Uh that you know clicking buttons and pushing things uh faster,

**[17:04]** buttons and pushing things uh faster,

**[17:04]** buttons and pushing things uh faster, pushing pieces through faster might not

**[17:06]** pushing pieces through faster might not

**[17:06]** pushing pieces through faster might not be the only way to do it, right? Like

**[17:08]** be the only way to do it, right? Like

**[17:08]** be the only way to do it, right? Like there's really an aspect of reasoning

**[17:10]** there's really an aspect of reasoning

**[17:10]** there's really an aspect of reasoning and connectivity that that we think

**[17:12]** and connectivity that that we think

**[17:12]** and connectivity that that we think about when we think about, you know, how

**[17:14]** about when we think about, you know, how

**[17:14]** about when we think about, you know, how to take errors that occur at the end of

**[17:16]** to take errors that occur at the end of

**[17:16]** to take errors that occur at the end of the process like the appeal process or

**[17:18]** the process like the appeal process or

**[17:18]** the process like the appeal process or the denial process and try to fix them

**[17:20]** the denial process and try to fix them

**[17:20]** the denial process and try to fix them upstream and early early on. And what

**[17:24]** we're really hoping for and what we're

**[17:24]** we're really hoping for and what we're really excited about is being able to

**[17:26]** really excited about is being able to

**[17:26]** really excited about is being able to not just build better tooling, but also

**[17:28]** not just build better tooling, but also

**[17:28]** not just build better tooling, but also a smarter, more coordinated system that

**[17:31]** a smarter, more coordinated system that

**[17:31]** a smarter, more coordinated system that allows us to reduce and uh reduce waste

**[17:34]** allows us to reduce and uh reduce waste

**[17:34]** allows us to reduce and uh reduce waste in the overall revenue cycle process.

**[17:39]** in the overall revenue cycle process.
