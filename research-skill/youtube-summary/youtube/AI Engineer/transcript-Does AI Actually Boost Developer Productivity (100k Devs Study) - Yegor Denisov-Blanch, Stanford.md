**[00:19]** In January of this year, Mark Zuckerberg

**[00:19]** In January of this year, Mark Zuckerberg said that he was going to replace all of

**[00:21]** said that he was going to replace all of

**[00:21]** said that he was going to replace all of the mid-level engineers at Meta with AI

**[00:24]** the mid-level engineers at Meta with AI

**[00:24]** the mid-level engineers at Meta with AI by the end of the year.

**[00:27]** by the end of the year.

**[00:27]** by the end of the year. I think Mark was a bit optimistic and he

**[00:30]** I think Mark was a bit optimistic and he

**[00:30]** I think Mark was a bit optimistic and he was probably acting like a good CEO

**[00:32]** was probably acting like a good CEO

**[00:32]** was probably acting like a good CEO would to inspire a vision and also

**[00:34]** would to inspire a vision and also

**[00:34]** would to inspire a vision and also probably to keep the Facebook stock

**[00:36]** probably to keep the Facebook stock

**[00:36]** probably to keep the Facebook stock price up. But what Mark also did was

**[00:40]** price up. But what Mark also did was

**[00:40]** price up. But what Mark also did was create a lot of trouble for CTOs

**[00:42]** create a lot of trouble for CTOs

**[00:42]** create a lot of trouble for CTOs worldwide.

**[00:44]** worldwide.

**[00:44]** worldwide. Why?

**[00:46]** Why?

**[00:46]** Why? Because after Mark said that, every

**[00:48]** Because after Mark said that, every

**[00:48]** Because after Mark said that, every single CEO in the world almost turned to

**[00:51]** single CEO in the world almost turned to

**[00:51]** single CEO in the world almost turned to their CTO and said, "Hey, Marcus says

**[00:54]** their CTO and said, "Hey, Marcus says

**[00:54]** their CTO and said, "Hey, Marcus says he's going to replace all of his

**[00:56]** he's going to replace all of his

**[00:56]** he's going to replace all of his developers with AI. Where are we in that

**[00:58]** developers with AI. Where are we in that

**[00:58]** developers with AI. Where are we in that journey?" And the answer probably was


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:01]** journey?" And the answer probably was

**[01:01]** journey?" And the answer probably was honestly not very far and we're not sure

**[01:03]** honestly not very far and we're not sure

**[01:03]** honestly not very far and we're not sure we're going to do that. And so I

**[01:06]** we're going to do that. And so I

**[01:06]** we're going to do that. And so I personally think hopefully this is not

**[01:09]** personally think hopefully this is not

**[01:09]** personally think hopefully this is not um you know going to going to change,

**[01:11]** um you know going to going to change,

**[01:11]** um you know going to going to change, but I don't think AI is going to replace

**[01:14]** but I don't think AI is going to replace

**[01:14]** but I don't think AI is going to replace developers entirely. at least at least

**[01:16]** developers entirely. at least at least

**[01:16]** developers entirely. at least at least this year, let alone at at at Meta,

**[01:18]** this year, let alone at at at Meta,

**[01:18]** this year, let alone at at at Meta, right? But um and I do think that AI

**[01:21]** right? But um and I do think that AI

**[01:21]** right? But um and I do think that AI increases developer productivity, but

**[01:22]** increases developer productivity, but

**[01:22]** increases developer productivity, but there's also cases in which it decreases

**[01:25]** there's also cases in which it decreases

**[01:25]** there's also cases in which it decreases developer productivity. So AI or using

**[01:28]** developer productivity. So AI or using

**[01:28]** developer productivity. So AI or using AI for coding is not a one-sizefits-all

**[01:31]** AI for coding is not a one-sizefits-all

**[01:31]** AI for coding is not a one-sizefits-all solution, and there are cases in which

**[01:33]** solution, and there are cases in which

**[01:33]** solution, and there are cases in which it shouldn't be used.

**[01:35]** it shouldn't be used.

**[01:35]** it shouldn't be used. And so for the past three years we've uh

**[01:38]** And so for the past three years we've uh

**[01:38]** And so for the past three years we've uh been running one of the larger uh

**[01:41]** been running one of the larger uh

**[01:41]** been running one of the larger uh studies on software engineering

**[01:43]** studies on software engineering

**[01:43]** studies on software engineering productivity at Stanford and we've done

**[01:46]** productivity at Stanford and we've done

**[01:46]** productivity at Stanford and we've done this in a time series and

**[01:47]** this in a time series and

**[01:47]** this in a time series and cross-sectional way. So time series

**[01:49]** cross-sectional way. So time series

**[01:49]** cross-sectional way. So time series meaning that even if a participant joins

**[01:51]** meaning that even if a participant joins

**[01:52]** meaning that even if a participant joins in 2025 we get access to their git

**[01:54]** in 2025 we get access to their git

**[01:54]** in 2025 we get access to their git history meaning we can see trends of

**[01:56]** history meaning we can see trends of

**[01:56]** history meaning we can see trends of data across time we can see covid we can

**[01:59]** data across time we can see covid we can

**[01:59]** data across time we can see covid we can see AI we can see all of these trends


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:00]** see AI we can see all of these trends

**[02:00]** see AI we can see all of these trends and and things that happened and then

**[02:03]** and and things that happened and then

**[02:03]** and and things that happened and then also cross-sectional because we have

**[02:05]** also cross-sectional because we have

**[02:05]** also cross-sectional because we have more than 600 companies participating

**[02:08]** more than 600 companies participating

**[02:08]** more than 600 companies participating enterprise midsized and also startups

**[02:11]** enterprise midsized and also startups

**[02:11]** enterprise midsized and also startups and so this means that we have more than

**[02:14]** and so this means that we have more than

**[02:14]** and so this means that we have more than 100,000 software engineers in our data

**[02:16]** 100,000 software engineers in our data

**[02:16]** 100,000 software engineers in our data set right now dozens of millions of

**[02:18]** set right now dozens of millions of

**[02:18]** set right now dozens of millions of commits and billions of lines of code.

**[02:22]** commits and billions of lines of code.

**[02:22]** commits and billions of lines of code. And most importantly, most of this data

**[02:24]** And most importantly, most of this data

**[02:24]** And most importantly, most of this data is private repositories.

**[02:27]** is private repositories.

**[02:27]** is private repositories. This is important because if you use a

**[02:28]** This is important because if you use a

**[02:28]** This is important because if you use a public repo to measure someone's

**[02:30]** public repo to measure someone's

**[02:30]** public repo to measure someone's productivity, that public repo is not

**[02:32]** productivity, that public repo is not

**[02:32]** productivity, that public repo is not self-contained. Someone could be working

**[02:34]** self-contained. Someone could be working

**[02:34]** self-contained. Someone could be working on that repo on the weekend or once in a

**[02:36]** on that repo on the weekend or once in a

**[02:36]** on that repo on the weekend or once in a while, right? Whereas if you have a

**[02:38]** while, right? Whereas if you have a

**[02:38]** while, right? Whereas if you have a private repo, it's much more

**[02:40]** private repo, it's much more

**[02:40]** private repo, it's much more self-contained and much easier to

**[02:42]** self-contained and much easier to

**[02:42]** self-contained and much easier to measure the productivity of a team, of a

**[02:43]** measure the productivity of a team, of a

**[02:43]** measure the productivity of a team, of a company, of an organization.

**[02:52]** So late last year there was a huge um

**[02:52]** So late last year there was a huge um controversial

**[02:53]** controversial

**[02:53]** controversial uh thing around ghost engineers. So this

**[02:55]** uh thing around ghost engineers. So this

**[02:55]** uh thing around ghost engineers. So this came from kind of the s the same

**[02:57]** came from kind of the s the same

**[02:57]** came from kind of the s the same research group our research group and

**[02:59]** research group our research group and

**[02:59]** research group our research group and here uh Elon Musk was kind enough to


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:01]** here uh Elon Musk was kind enough to

**[03:01]** here uh Elon Musk was kind enough to retweet us. But what we found is that

**[03:04]** retweet us. But what we found is that

**[03:04]** retweet us. But what we found is that roughly 10% of software engineers in our

**[03:06]** roughly 10% of software engineers in our

**[03:06]** roughly 10% of software engineers in our data set at the time about 50,000 were

**[03:09]** data set at the time about 50,000 were

**[03:09]** data set at the time about 50,000 were what we called ghost engineers.

**[03:12]** what we called ghost engineers.

**[03:12]** what we called ghost engineers. These people collect a paycheck but

**[03:14]** These people collect a paycheck but

**[03:14]** These people collect a paycheck but basically do no work.

**[03:16]** basically do no work.

**[03:16]** basically do no work. So that was very surprising for some

**[03:19]** So that was very surprising for some

**[03:19]** So that was very surprising for some people, very unsurprising for others.

**[03:22]** people, very unsurprising for others.

**[03:22]** people, very unsurprising for others. And so some of the people in this

**[03:23]** And so some of the people in this

**[03:24]** And so some of the people in this research team are for example Simon from

**[03:26]** research team are for example Simon from

**[03:26]** research team are for example Simon from industry. Uh so he was CTO at a unicorn

**[03:30]** industry. Uh so he was CTO at a unicorn

**[03:30]** industry. Uh so he was CTO at a unicorn which he exited and he had a team of

**[03:32]** which he exited and he had a team of

**[03:32]** which he exited and he had a team of about 700 developers and as CTO he was

**[03:35]** about 700 developers and as CTO he was

**[03:35]** about 700 developers and as CTO he was always the last person to know when

**[03:37]** always the last person to know when

**[03:37]** always the last person to know when something was up with his engineering

**[03:38]** something was up with his engineering

**[03:38]** something was up with his engineering team right and so he thought okay how

**[03:40]** team right and so he thought okay how

**[03:40]** team right and so he thought okay how can I change this?

**[03:42]** can I change this?

**[03:42]** can I change this? Myself, I've been at Stanford since 22

**[03:45]** Myself, I've been at Stanford since 22

**[03:45]** Myself, I've been at Stanford since 22 and I focus on what I call datadriven

**[03:47]** and I focus on what I call datadriven

**[03:47]** and I focus on what I call datadriven decision-making in software engineering

**[03:50]** decision-making in software engineering

**[03:50]** decision-making in software engineering and in a past life I was looking after

**[03:52]** and in a past life I was looking after

**[03:52]** and in a past life I was looking after digital transformation for a large

**[03:54]** digital transformation for a large

**[03:54]** digital transformation for a large company with thousands of engineers.

**[03:57]** company with thousands of engineers.

**[03:57]** company with thousands of engineers. Part of the team is also professor

**[03:59]** Part of the team is also professor

**[03:59]** Part of the team is also professor Kasinski who was at Stanford and his


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:02]** Kasinski who was at Stanford and his

**[04:02]** Kasinski who was at Stanford and his research focuses on human behavior in a

**[04:04]** research focuses on human behavior in a

**[04:04]** research focuses on human behavior in a digital environment and basically he was

**[04:06]** digital environment and basically he was

**[04:06]** digital environment and basically he was the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower

**[04:07]** the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower

**[04:07]** the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower back in the day if you recall that.

**[04:11]** back in the day if you recall that.

**[04:11]** back in the day if you recall that. So today we're going to be talking about

**[04:12]** So today we're going to be talking about

**[04:12]** So today we're going to be talking about three things.

**[04:14]** three things.

**[04:14]** three things. We're going to start off with the

**[04:15]** We're going to start off with the

**[04:15]** We're going to start off with the limitations of existing studies that

**[04:18]** limitations of existing studies that

**[04:18]** limitations of existing studies that seek to quantify the impact of AI on

**[04:20]** seek to quantify the impact of AI on

**[04:20]** seek to quantify the impact of AI on developer productivity.

**[04:22]** developer productivity.

**[04:22]** developer productivity. We're going to showcase our methodology.

**[04:25]** We're going to showcase our methodology.

**[04:25]** We're going to showcase our methodology. And lastly, we're going to spend most of

**[04:26]** And lastly, we're going to spend most of

**[04:26]** And lastly, we're going to spend most of the time looking at some of the results.

**[04:27]** the time looking at some of the results.

**[04:27]** the time looking at some of the results. What is the impact on AI on deaf

**[04:29]** What is the impact on AI on deaf

**[04:29]** What is the impact on AI on deaf productivity? And how are ways we can

**[04:31]** productivity? And how are ways we can

**[04:31]** productivity? And how are ways we can slice and dice these results to make

**[04:33]** slice and dice these results to make

**[04:33]** slice and dice these results to make them more meaningful?

**[04:40]** And so there's lots of research being

**[04:40]** And so there's lots of research being done on this topic, but a lot of it is

**[04:43]** done on this topic, but a lot of it is

**[04:43]** done on this topic, but a lot of it is led by vendors who themselves are trying

**[04:45]** led by vendors who themselves are trying

**[04:46]** led by vendors who themselves are trying to sell you their own AI coding tools,

**[04:48]** to sell you their own AI coding tools,

**[04:48]** to sell you their own AI coding tools, right? And so there's a bit of a

**[04:50]** right? And so there's a bit of a

**[04:50]** right? And so there's a bit of a conflict of interest there sometimes.

**[04:51]** conflict of interest there sometimes.

**[04:51]** conflict of interest there sometimes. And the biggest three limitations that I

**[04:53]** And the biggest three limitations that I

**[04:54]** And the biggest three limitations that I see is that a lot of these studies

**[04:55]** see is that a lot of these studies

**[04:55]** see is that a lot of these studies revolve around commits and PRs and

**[04:57]** revolve around commits and PRs and

**[04:58]** revolve around commits and PRs and tasks. Hey, we completed more commits,


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:00]** tasks. Hey, we completed more commits,

**[05:00]** tasks. Hey, we completed more commits, more PRs. The time between commits

**[05:02]** more PRs. The time between commits

**[05:02]** more PRs. The time between commits decreased.

**[05:04]** decreased.

**[05:04]** decreased. The problem here is that task size

**[05:06]** The problem here is that task size

**[05:06]** The problem here is that task size varies, right? And so delivering more

**[05:08]** varies, right? And so delivering more

**[05:08]** varies, right? And so delivering more commits does not necessarily mean more

**[05:11]** commits does not necessarily mean more

**[05:11]** commits does not necessarily mean more productivity.

**[05:12]** productivity.

**[05:12]** productivity. And in fact, what we found very often is

**[05:15]** And in fact, what we found very often is

**[05:15]** And in fact, what we found very often is that by using AI, you're introducing new

**[05:17]** that by using AI, you're introducing new

**[05:17]** that by using AI, you're introducing new tasks that are bug fixes to the stuff

**[05:20]** tasks that are bug fixes to the stuff

**[05:20]** tasks that are bug fixes to the stuff that the AI just coded before. So by

**[05:22]** that the AI just coded before. So by

**[05:22]** that the AI just coded before. So by that case, like you're kind of spinning

**[05:24]** that case, like you're kind of spinning

**[05:24]** that case, like you're kind of spinning your wheels in place, right? So that's

**[05:26]** your wheels in place, right? So that's

**[05:26]** your wheels in place, right? So that's kind of funny.

**[05:29]** kind of funny.

**[05:29]** kind of funny. Secondly, there's a bunch of studies who

**[05:30]** Secondly, there's a bunch of studies who

**[05:30]** Secondly, there's a bunch of studies who say, well, we grabbed a bunch of

**[05:32]** say, well, we grabbed a bunch of

**[05:32]** say, well, we grabbed a bunch of developers, we split them into two

**[05:33]** developers, we split them into two

**[05:33]** developers, we split them into two groups and we kind of gave one AI and

**[05:36]** groups and we kind of gave one AI and

**[05:36]** groups and we kind of gave one AI and one of them we didn't. And what usually

**[05:38]** one of them we didn't. And what usually

**[05:38]** one of them we didn't. And what usually happens there is that these are kind of

**[05:40]** happens there is that these are kind of

**[05:40]** happens there is that these are kind of green field tasks where they're asked to

**[05:42]** green field tasks where they're asked to

**[05:42]** green field tasks where they're asked to build something with kind of zero

**[05:43]** build something with kind of zero

**[05:43]** build something with kind of zero context from scratch. And there of

**[05:45]** context from scratch. And there of

**[05:45]** context from scratch. And there of course AI decimates uh the non-AI

**[05:48]** course AI decimates uh the non-AI

**[05:48]** course AI decimates uh the non-AI people, but that's because AI is just

**[05:50]** people, but that's because AI is just

**[05:50]** people, but that's because AI is just really good at green field kind of

**[05:52]** really good at green field kind of

**[05:52]** really good at green field kind of boilerplate code, right? But actually

**[05:54]** boilerplate code, right? But actually

**[05:54]** boilerplate code, right? But actually most of software engineering isn't green

**[05:57]** most of software engineering isn't green

**[05:57]** most of software engineering isn't green field and isn't always boiler

**[05:59]** field and isn't always boiler

**[05:59]** field and isn't always boiler boilerplate, right? And so there's


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:01]** boilerplate, right? And so there's

**[06:01]** boilerplate, right? And so there's usually an existing codebase. There's

**[06:03]** usually an existing codebase. There's

**[06:03]** usually an existing codebase. There's usually dependencies. So these studies

**[06:05]** usually dependencies. So these studies

**[06:05]** usually dependencies. So these studies can't be like applied too too well to

**[06:07]** can't be like applied too too well to

**[06:07]** can't be like applied too too well to these situations either.

**[06:10]** these situations either.

**[06:10]** these situations either. And then we also have surveys which we

**[06:12]** And then we also have surveys which we

**[06:12]** And then we also have surveys which we found to be an ineffective predictor of

**[06:14]** found to be an ineffective predictor of

**[06:14]** found to be an ineffective predictor of productivity by doing this small

**[06:16]** productivity by doing this small

**[06:16]** productivity by doing this small experiment with 43 developers whereby we

**[06:19]** experiment with 43 developers whereby we

**[06:20]** experiment with 43 developers whereby we ask every developer to evaluate

**[06:21]** ask every developer to evaluate

**[06:22]** ask every developer to evaluate themselves relative to the global mean

**[06:24]** themselves relative to the global mean

**[06:24]** themselves relative to the global mean or median in five percentile uh buckets

**[06:28]** or median in five percentile uh buckets

**[06:28]** or median in five percentile uh buckets from 0 to 100 and then we compared that

**[06:31]** from 0 to 100 and then we compared that

**[06:31]** from 0 to 100 and then we compared that to their measured productivity. We'll

**[06:33]** to their measured productivity. We'll

**[06:33]** to their measured productivity. We'll get into what that means later, but what

**[06:35]** get into what that means later, but what

**[06:35]** get into what that means later, but what we found is that asking someone how

**[06:37]** we found is that asking someone how

**[06:37]** we found is that asking someone how productive they think they are is almost

**[06:39]** productive they think they are is almost

**[06:39]** productive they think they are is almost as good as flipping a coin. There's very

**[06:41]** as good as flipping a coin. There's very

**[06:41]** as good as flipping a coin. There's very little correlation, right? And so we

**[06:43]** little correlation, right? And so we

**[06:43]** little correlation, right? And so we found that people misjudged their

**[06:45]** found that people misjudged their

**[06:45]** found that people misjudged their productivity by about 30 percentile

**[06:47]** productivity by about 30 percentile

**[06:47]** productivity by about 30 percentile points.

**[06:49]** points.

**[06:49]** points. Only one in three people actually

**[06:51]** Only one in three people actually

**[06:51]** Only one in three people actually estimated their productivity within

**[06:53]** estimated their productivity within

**[06:53]** estimated their productivity within their quartile, one quartile. And I

**[06:56]** their quartile, one quartile. And I

**[06:56]** their quartile, one quartile. And I think surveys are great. They're

**[06:57]** think surveys are great. They're

**[06:57]** think surveys are great. They're valuable for surfacing, you know, morale

**[06:59]** valuable for surfacing, you know, morale

**[06:59]** valuable for surfacing, you know, morale and other issues that cannot be derived


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:01]** and other issues that cannot be derived

**[07:01]** and other issues that cannot be derived from metrics. But service shouldn't be

**[07:04]** from metrics. But service shouldn't be

**[07:04]** from metrics. But service shouldn't be used to measure developer productivity

**[07:06]** used to measure developer productivity

**[07:06]** used to measure developer productivity much less the impact of AI on developers

**[07:10]** much less the impact of AI on developers

**[07:10]** much less the impact of AI on developers for productivity cases. You can measure

**[07:12]** for productivity cases. You can measure

**[07:12]** for productivity cases. You can measure it to kind of see how happy they are

**[07:13]** it to kind of see how happy they are

**[07:13]** it to kind of see how happy they are using AI or whatever I suppose. Um

**[07:18]** using AI or whatever I suppose. Um

**[07:18]** using AI or whatever I suppose. Um great. So now let's dive into our

**[07:20]** great. So now let's dive into our

**[07:20]** great. So now let's dive into our methodology. So in an ideal world, you

**[07:23]** methodology. So in an ideal world, you

**[07:23]** methodology. So in an ideal world, you would have an engineer who writes code

**[07:25]** would have an engineer who writes code

**[07:25]** would have an engineer who writes code and this code is evaluated by a panel of

**[07:28]** and this code is evaluated by a panel of

**[07:28]** and this code is evaluated by a panel of 10 or 15 experts who separately without

**[07:32]** 10 or 15 experts who separately without

**[07:32]** 10 or 15 experts who separately without knowing what every person is uh

**[07:34]** knowing what every person is uh

**[07:34]** knowing what every person is uh answering evaluates that code based on

**[07:37]** answering evaluates that code based on

**[07:37]** answering evaluates that code based on quality, maintainability, output, how

**[07:39]** quality, maintainability, output, how

**[07:39]** quality, maintainability, output, how long would this take me, how good is it,

**[07:41]** long would this take me, how good is it,

**[07:41]** long would this take me, how good is it, right? kind of like a bucket of

**[07:43]** right? kind of like a bucket of

**[07:43]** right? kind of like a bucket of questions and then um what happens is

**[07:46]** questions and then um what happens is

**[07:46]** questions and then um what happens is that you aggregate those results and we

**[07:49]** that you aggregate those results and we

**[07:49]** that you aggregate those results and we found two things. The first one is that

**[07:51]** found two things. The first one is that

**[07:52]** found two things. The first one is that this panel actually agrees with one

**[07:53]** this panel actually agrees with one

**[07:53]** this panel actually agrees with one another. So it turns out that one

**[07:55]** another. So it turns out that one

**[07:56]** another. So it turns out that one engineering expert agrees with the other

**[07:57]** engineering expert agrees with the other

**[07:57]** engineering expert agrees with the other engineering expert when they're talking

**[07:59]** engineering expert when they're talking

**[07:59]** engineering expert when they're talking about an objective code in front of


### [08:00 - 09:00]

**[08:01]** about an objective code in front of

**[08:01]** about an objective code in front of them. And secondly and probably most

**[08:04]** them. And secondly and probably most

**[08:04]** them. And secondly and probably most importantly is that you can use this to

**[08:06]** importantly is that you can use this to

**[08:06]** importantly is that you can use this to predict reality. And reality is

**[08:08]** predict reality. And reality is

**[08:08]** predict reality. And reality is predicted by a panel like this. The

**[08:11]** predicted by a panel like this. The

**[08:11]** predicted by a panel like this. The problem then is that this is very slow.

**[08:13]** problem then is that this is very slow.

**[08:13]** problem then is that this is very slow. It's not scalable. It's expensive. Um,

**[08:16]** It's not scalable. It's expensive. Um,

**[08:16]** It's not scalable. It's expensive. Um, and so what we did is we built a model

**[08:17]** and so what we did is we built a model

**[08:17]** and so what we did is we built a model that essentially automates this,

**[08:19]** that essentially automates this,

**[08:19]** that essentially automates this, correlates pretty well, it's fast, it's

**[08:21]** correlates pretty well, it's fast, it's

**[08:21]** correlates pretty well, it's fast, it's scalable, and it's affordable.

**[08:24]** scalable, and it's affordable.

**[08:24]** scalable, and it's affordable. The way it works is it plugs into git

**[08:26]** The way it works is it plugs into git

**[08:26]** The way it works is it plugs into git and then the model analyzes the source

**[08:29]** and then the model analyzes the source

**[08:29]** and then the model analyzes the source code changes of every commit and

**[08:31]** code changes of every commit and

**[08:31]** code changes of every commit and quantifies them based on a bunch of

**[08:32]** quantifies them based on a bunch of

**[08:32]** quantifies them based on a bunch of these dimensions.

**[08:35]** these dimensions.

**[08:35]** these dimensions. And then since every commit has a unique

**[08:37]** And then since every commit has a unique

**[08:37]** And then since every commit has a unique author, a unique sha, a unique time

**[08:40]** author, a unique sha, a unique time

**[08:40]** author, a unique sha, a unique time stamp, then you can kind of understand

**[08:42]** stamp, then you can kind of understand

**[08:42]** stamp, then you can kind of understand okay the productivity of a team is

**[08:44]** okay the productivity of a team is

**[08:44]** okay the productivity of a team is basically the functionality of the code

**[08:47]** basically the functionality of the code

**[08:47]** basically the functionality of the code they delivered across time, not the

**[08:49]** they delivered across time, not the

**[08:49]** they delivered across time, not the lines of code, not the whatever commits,

**[08:51]** lines of code, not the whatever commits,

**[08:52]** lines of code, not the whatever commits, but the fun like what that code is

**[08:53]** but the fun like what that code is

**[08:53]** but the fun like what that code is doing, right? And so then you can kind

**[08:56]** doing, right? And so then you can kind

**[08:56]** doing, right? And so then you can kind of put this in a dashboard and uh

**[08:57]** of put this in a dashboard and uh

**[08:58]** of put this in a dashboard and uh overlay it across time and get something

**[08:59]** overlay it across time and get something


### [09:00 - 10:00]

**[09:00]** overlay it across time and get something similar to this.

**[09:07]** Great. So now let's dive into some of

**[09:07]** Great. So now let's dive into some of our results.

**[09:10]** our results.

**[09:10]** our results. So here in September is when this

**[09:12]** So here in September is when this

**[09:12]** So here in September is when this company implemented AI. This is a team

**[09:15]** company implemented AI. This is a team

**[09:15]** company implemented AI. This is a team of about 120 developers and they were

**[09:18]** of about 120 developers and they were

**[09:18]** of about 120 developers and they were piloting whether they wanted to use uh

**[09:20]** piloting whether they wanted to use uh

**[09:20]** piloting whether they wanted to use uh you know AI in their kind of regular

**[09:22]** you know AI in their kind of regular

**[09:22]** you know AI in their kind of regular workflow. And we have here um these bars

**[09:25]** workflow. And we have here um these bars

**[09:25]** workflow. And we have here um these bars and every bar is the sum total of the

**[09:27]** and every bar is the sum total of the

**[09:27]** and every bar is the sum total of the output done in that month using our

**[09:30]** output done in that month using our

**[09:30]** output done in that month using our methodology not lines of code. And we

**[09:33]** methodology not lines of code. And we

**[09:33]** methodology not lines of code. And we can see that in green it's added

**[09:34]** can see that in green it's added

**[09:34]** can see that in green it's added functionality. In gray it's removed.

**[09:38]** functionality. In gray it's removed.

**[09:38]** functionality. In gray it's removed. In blue is refactoring and in orange is

**[09:40]** In blue is refactoring and in orange is

**[09:40]** In blue is refactoring and in orange is reworked. And so rework versus

**[09:42]** reworked. And so rework versus

**[09:42]** reworked. And so rework versus refactoring. They both alter existing

**[09:44]** refactoring. They both alter existing

**[09:44]** refactoring. They both alter existing code. But rework alters code that's much

**[09:47]** code. But rework alters code that's much

**[09:47]** code. But rework alters code that's much more recent. Meaning it's wasteful.

**[09:49]** more recent. Meaning it's wasteful.

**[09:49]** more recent. Meaning it's wasteful. Refactoring could be wasteful, could be

**[09:51]** Refactoring could be wasteful, could be

**[09:51]** Refactoring could be wasteful, could be not wasteful.

**[09:52]** not wasteful.

**[09:52]** not wasteful. And so from the get-go, you see that by

**[09:54]** And so from the get-go, you see that by

**[09:54]** And so from the get-go, you see that by implementing AI, you get a bunch more of

**[09:57]** implementing AI, you get a bunch more of

**[09:57]** implementing AI, you get a bunch more of rework.

**[09:59]** rework.

**[09:59]** rework. What happens is that you feel like


### [10:00 - 11:00]

**[10:00]** What happens is that you feel like

**[10:00]** What happens is that you feel like you're delivering more code because

**[10:01]** you're delivering more code because

**[10:01]** you're delivering more code because there's just like more volume of code

**[10:03]** there's just like more volume of code

**[10:03]** there's just like more volume of code being written, more commits, more stuff

**[10:04]** being written, more commits, more stuff

**[10:04]** being written, more commits, more stuff being pushed. But not all of that is

**[10:06]** being pushed. But not all of that is

**[10:06]** being pushed. But not all of that is actually useful. To be clear, I think

**[10:09]** actually useful. To be clear, I think

**[10:09]** actually useful. To be clear, I think there I mean based on this chart and

**[10:11]** there I mean based on this chart and

**[10:11]** there I mean based on this chart and overall there is a productivity boost of

**[10:13]** overall there is a productivity boost of

**[10:13]** overall there is a productivity boost of about 15 to 20%. But then a lot of the

**[10:16]** about 15 to 20%. But then a lot of the

**[10:16]** about 15 to 20%. But then a lot of the gains you're seeing are uh basically

**[10:20]** gains you're seeing are uh basically

**[10:20]** gains you're seeing are uh basically this kind of rework which is a bit you

**[10:23]** this kind of rework which is a bit you

**[10:23]** this kind of rework which is a bit you know misleading.

**[10:24]** know misleading.

**[10:24]** know misleading. So if I could summarize it into one

**[10:27]** So if I could summarize it into one

**[10:27]** So if I could summarize it into one chart with many discrepancies it would

**[10:29]** chart with many discrepancies it would

**[10:29]** chart with many discrepancies it would be something like this. So with AI

**[10:32]** be something like this. So with AI

**[10:32]** be something like this. So with AI coding you generate or you increase your

**[10:34]** coding you generate or you increase your

**[10:34]** coding you generate or you increase your productivity by roughly 30 40%. Right?

**[10:36]** productivity by roughly 30 40%. Right?

**[10:36]** productivity by roughly 30 40%. Right? You're delivering more code. However,

**[10:38]** You're delivering more code. However,

**[10:38]** You're delivering more code. However, you got to go back and kind of fix some

**[10:40]** you got to go back and kind of fix some

**[10:40]** you got to go back and kind of fix some of the bugs that code introduced and

**[10:42]** of the bugs that code introduced and

**[10:42]** of the bugs that code introduced and kind of, you know, fix the the the mess

**[10:44]** kind of, you know, fix the the the mess

**[10:44]** kind of, you know, fix the the the mess that the AI made, which in turn gives

**[10:47]** that the AI made, which in turn gives

**[10:47]** that the AI made, which in turn gives you an average productivity gain across

**[10:49]** you an average productivity gain across

**[10:49]** you an average productivity gain across all industries, all sectors, everything

**[10:51]** all industries, all sectors, everything

**[10:51]** all industries, all sectors, everything of roughly about 15 to 20%.

**[10:56]** of roughly about 15 to 20%.

**[10:56]** of roughly about 15 to 20%. There's a lot of new ones here, which

**[10:58]** There's a lot of new ones here, which

**[10:58]** There's a lot of new ones here, which we're going to see in just a second.


### [11:00 - 12:00]

**[11:03]** we're going to see in just a second.

**[11:03]** we're going to see in just a second. So here we have two violin charts and

**[11:06]** So here we have two violin charts and

**[11:06]** So here we have two violin charts and they plot the distributions of the gains

**[11:09]** they plot the distributions of the gains

**[11:09]** they plot the distributions of the gains in productivity from using AI and so

**[11:13]** in productivity from using AI and so

**[11:13]** in productivity from using AI and so kind of like the y-axis is the gains. It

**[11:15]** kind of like the y-axis is the gains. It

**[11:15]** kind of like the y-axis is the gains. It starts from minus 20%, take note, and

**[11:18]** starts from minus 20%, take note, and

**[11:18]** starts from minus 20%, take note, and then it goes up. And here we have kind

**[11:20]** then it goes up. And here we have kind

**[11:20]** then it goes up. And here we have kind of four pieces of data being shown. In

**[11:23]** of four pieces of data being shown. In

**[11:23]** of four pieces of data being shown. In blue is low complexity tasks

**[11:26]** blue is low complexity tasks

**[11:26]** blue is low complexity tasks and in red is high complexity tasks

**[11:30]** and in red is high complexity tasks

**[11:30]** and in red is high complexity tasks and kind of like your left uh the chart

**[11:33]** and kind of like your left uh the chart

**[11:33]** and kind of like your left uh the chart to the left is green field tasks, the

**[11:36]** to the left is green field tasks, the

**[11:36]** to the left is green field tasks, the chart to the right is brown field tasks.

**[11:38]** chart to the right is brown field tasks.

**[11:38]** chart to the right is brown field tasks. So right from the get-go, the first

**[11:39]** So right from the get-go, the first

**[11:39]** So right from the get-go, the first conclusion we have is that sure it seems

**[11:42]** conclusion we have is that sure it seems

**[11:42]** conclusion we have is that sure it seems like AI performs better in coding with

**[11:45]** like AI performs better in coding with

**[11:45]** like AI performs better in coding with simpler tasks. That's good. It's proven

**[11:47]** simpler tasks. That's good. It's proven

**[11:47]** simpler tasks. That's good. It's proven by data. That's awesome. The second

**[11:49]** by data. That's awesome. The second

**[11:50]** by data. That's awesome. The second thing we see is that hey, it sounds like

**[11:52]** thing we see is that hey, it sounds like

**[11:52]** thing we see is that hey, it sounds like for low complexity green field tasks,

**[11:55]** for low complexity green field tasks,

**[11:55]** for low complexity green field tasks, there is a much more elongated

**[11:58]** there is a much more elongated

**[11:58]** there is a much more elongated distribution and a much higher


### [12:00 - 13:00]

**[12:00]** distribution and a much higher

**[12:00]** distribution and a much higher distribution on average. Keep in mind

**[12:02]** distribution on average. Keep in mind

**[12:02]** distribution on average. Keep in mind that this is for enterprise settings.

**[12:04]** that this is for enterprise settings.

**[12:04]** that this is for enterprise settings. This doesn't apply for kind of like

**[12:05]** This doesn't apply for kind of like

**[12:05]** This doesn't apply for kind of like personal projects or vibe coding

**[12:07]** personal projects or vibe coding

**[12:07]** personal projects or vibe coding something for yourself from scratch. The

**[12:10]** something for yourself from scratch. The

**[12:10]** something for yourself from scratch. The improvements there would be much bigger.

**[12:11]** improvements there would be much bigger.

**[12:11]** improvements there would be much bigger. This is kind of for like real world

**[12:13]** This is kind of for like real world

**[12:14]** This is kind of for like real world working company settings.

**[12:16]** working company settings.

**[12:16]** working company settings. And the third thing we see is that if

**[12:18]** And the third thing we see is that if

**[12:18]** And the third thing we see is that if you look at the high complexity tasks, I

**[12:20]** you look at the high complexity tasks, I

**[12:20]** you look at the high complexity tasks, I mean they're lower than the low

**[12:21]** mean they're lower than the low

**[12:21]** mean they're lower than the low complexity ones in average in terms of

**[12:23]** complexity ones in average in terms of

**[12:23]** complexity ones in average in terms of the distribution, but also in some cases

**[12:27]** the distribution, but also in some cases

**[12:27]** the distribution, but also in some cases they are more likely to decrease an

**[12:30]** they are more likely to decrease an

**[12:30]** they are more likely to decrease an engineer's productivity.

**[12:32]** engineer's productivity.

**[12:32]** engineer's productivity. Now this decrease could be for many

**[12:34]** Now this decrease could be for many

**[12:34]** Now this decrease could be for many things, many reasons, but that's kind of

**[12:37]** things, many reasons, but that's kind of

**[12:37]** things, many reasons, but that's kind of what we see in the data, right? The

**[12:38]** what we see in the data, right? The

**[12:38]** what we see in the data, right? The underlying causes are still not super

**[12:41]** underlying causes are still not super

**[12:41]** underlying causes are still not super clear to us.

**[12:43]** clear to us.

**[12:43]** clear to us. If we translate this to a chart like

**[12:45]** If we translate this to a chart like

**[12:46]** If we translate this to a chart like this, which is a bit more digestible,

**[12:48]** this, which is a bit more digestible,

**[12:48]** this, which is a bit more digestible, you have uh in in the bars and the

**[12:50]** you have uh in in the bars and the

**[12:50]** you have uh in in the bars and the columns

**[12:52]** columns

**[12:52]** columns kind of like the average or the median

**[12:54]** kind of like the average or the median

**[12:54]** kind of like the average or the median gain and then the line represents the

**[12:57]** gain and then the line represents the

**[12:57]** gain and then the line represents the interquartile range. So the bottom of

**[12:59]** interquartile range. So the bottom of

**[12:59]** interquartile range. So the bottom of the line is the 25th percentile and the


### [13:00 - 14:00]

**[13:01]** the line is the 25th percentile and the

**[13:01]** the line is the 25th percentile and the top of the line is roughly 75th

**[13:03]** top of the line is roughly 75th

**[13:03]** top of the line is roughly 75th percentile. And so here it's very clear

**[13:05]** percentile. And so here it's very clear

**[13:05]** percentile. And so here it's very clear to see how we have you know more gains

**[13:08]** to see how we have you know more gains

**[13:08]** to see how we have you know more gains from low complexity tasks, less gains

**[13:10]** from low complexity tasks, less gains

**[13:10]** from low complexity tasks, less gains from uh high complexity tasks and then

**[13:12]** from uh high complexity tasks and then

**[13:12]** from uh high complexity tasks and then brownfield it's harder to leverage AI um

**[13:15]** brownfield it's harder to leverage AI um

**[13:15]** brownfield it's harder to leverage AI um to make increases in productivity there

**[13:18]** to make increases in productivity there

**[13:18]** to make increases in productivity there compared to green field.

**[13:24]** So if there is maybe a slide that you

**[13:24]** So if there is maybe a slide that you could show to your leadership team, it

**[13:26]** could show to your leadership team, it

**[13:26]** could show to your leadership team, it could be this one or it could also be

**[13:27]** could be this one or it could also be

**[13:27]** could be this one or it could also be this one. So here we have a matrix

**[13:29]** this one. So here we have a matrix

**[13:29]** this one. So here we have a matrix really simplifying things you know

**[13:31]** really simplifying things you know

**[13:31]** really simplifying things you know reality is a bit more difficult than

**[13:32]** reality is a bit more difficult than

**[13:32]** reality is a bit more difficult than this but here we have kind of on one

**[13:34]** this but here we have kind of on one

**[13:34]** this but here we have kind of on one axis task complexity low and high on the

**[13:37]** axis task complexity low and high on the

**[13:37]** axis task complexity low and high on the other one project maturity green field

**[13:39]** other one project maturity green field

**[13:39]** other one project maturity green field versus brownfield kind of if we see that

**[13:41]** versus brownfield kind of if we see that

**[13:41]** versus brownfield kind of if we see that hey low complexity green field 30 to 40%

**[13:44]** hey low complexity green field 30 to 40%

**[13:44]** hey low complexity green field 30 to 40% gains right from AI

**[13:46]** gains right from AI

**[13:46]** gains right from AI high complexity but green field more

**[13:48]** high complexity but green field more

**[13:48]** high complexity but green field more modest gains 10 to 15

**[13:52]** modest gains 10 to 15

**[13:52]** modest gains 10 to 15 brown field and low complexity pretty

**[13:54]** brown field and low complexity pretty

**[13:54]** brown field and low complexity pretty good 15 to 20%. And most importantly,

**[13:57]** good 15 to 20%. And most importantly,

**[13:57]** good 15 to 20%. And most importantly, high complexity brownfield tasks 0 to


### [14:00 - 15:00]

**[14:00]** high complexity brownfield tasks 0 to

**[14:00]** high complexity brownfield tasks 0 to 10%.

**[14:02]** 10%.

**[14:02]** 10%. These are orientative guidelines based

**[14:04]** These are orientative guidelines based

**[14:04]** These are orientative guidelines based on what you see what we see in the data.

**[14:06]** on what you see what we see in the data.

**[14:06]** on what you see what we see in the data. And I forgot to mention uh this slide

**[14:08]** And I forgot to mention uh this slide

**[14:08]** And I forgot to mention uh this slide has a sample size of 136 teams across 27

**[14:11]** has a sample size of 136 teams across 27

**[14:11]** has a sample size of 136 teams across 27 companies. So pretty representative.

**[14:14]** companies. So pretty representative.

**[14:14]** companies. So pretty representative. Um and then that's going to derive or

**[14:16]** Um and then that's going to derive or

**[14:16]** Um and then that's going to derive or this chart is derived from that data.

**[14:23]** Then here we have a similar matrix

**[14:23]** Then here we have a similar matrix except at the bottom we have language

**[14:25]** except at the bottom we have language

**[14:25]** except at the bottom we have language popularity.

**[14:27]** popularity.

**[14:27]** popularity. So in low we have examples such as coobo

**[14:29]** So in low we have examples such as coobo

**[14:29]** So in low we have examples such as coobo hasll elixir really kind of obscure

**[14:31]** hasll elixir really kind of obscure

**[14:48]** useful. And what ends up happening is that people just don't use it. Because

**[14:49]** that people just don't use it. Because

**[14:49]** that people just don't use it. Because if it's only helpful two times out of

**[14:51]** if it's only helpful two times out of

**[14:51]** if it's only helpful two times out of five, you're just not going to use it

**[14:52]** five, you're just not going to use it

**[14:52]** five, you're just not going to use it very often.

**[14:54]** very often.

**[14:54]** very often. What's funny or interesting is that for

**[14:56]** What's funny or interesting is that for

**[14:56]** What's funny or interesting is that for low language popularity and complex

**[14:58]** low language popularity and complex

**[14:58]** low language popularity and complex tasks, AI can actually decrease


### [15:00 - 16:00]

**[15:00]** tasks, AI can actually decrease

**[15:00]** tasks, AI can actually decrease productivity because it's so bad at

**[15:01]** productivity because it's so bad at

**[15:01]** productivity because it's so bad at coding in Cobalt or Haskell or Elixir

**[15:03]** coding in Cobalt or Haskell or Elixir

**[15:03]** coding in Cobalt or Haskell or Elixir that it just makes you slower. Right?

**[15:06]** that it just makes you slower. Right?

**[15:06]** that it just makes you slower. Right? Granted, this isn't very like this

**[15:09]** Granted, this isn't very like this

**[15:09]** Granted, this isn't very like this happens, but it may be five or 10% of

**[15:11]** happens, but it may be five or 10% of

**[15:11]** happens, but it may be five or 10% of the kind of global development work if

**[15:13]** the kind of global development work if

**[15:13]** the kind of global development work if that, right?

**[15:15]** that, right?

**[15:15]** that, right? Most of the development work is probably

**[15:17]** Most of the development work is probably

**[15:17]** Most of the development work is probably somewhere in the langu in the high

**[15:18]** somewhere in the langu in the high

**[15:18]** somewhere in the langu in the high language popularity kind of part of the

**[15:20]** language popularity kind of part of the

**[15:20]** language popularity kind of part of the chart. And here you have gains between

**[15:23]** chart. And here you have gains between

**[15:23]** chart. And here you have gains between 20% for the low complexity and 10 to 15%

**[15:26]** 20% for the low complexity and 10 to 15%

**[15:26]** 20% for the low complexity and 10 to 15% for the high complexity.

**[15:37]** So now moving into something a bit more

**[15:37]** So now moving into something a bit more theoretical, less empirically proven,

**[15:40]** theoretical, less empirically proven,

**[15:40]** theoretical, less empirically proven, but more so kind of like what we're

**[15:42]** but more so kind of like what we're

**[15:42]** but more so kind of like what we're seeing in in in the data, right? This is

**[15:44]** seeing in in in the data, right? This is

**[15:44]** seeing in in in the data, right? This is like an illustrative chart which has

**[15:45]** like an illustrative chart which has

**[15:46]** like an illustrative chart which has kind of productivity gain from AI on the

**[15:48]** kind of productivity gain from AI on the

**[15:48]** kind of productivity gain from AI on the y-axis and a logarithmic scale of the

**[15:51]** y-axis and a logarithmic scale of the

**[15:51]** y-axis and a logarithmic scale of the codebase size right from 1,000 lines of

**[15:53]** codebase size right from 1,000 lines of

**[15:53]** codebase size right from 1,000 lines of code to 10 million on the x-axis. And we

**[15:56]** code to 10 million on the x-axis. And we

**[15:56]** code to 10 million on the x-axis. And we see that as the codebase size increases

**[15:59]** see that as the codebase size increases

**[15:59]** see that as the codebase size increases the gains you get from AI decrease


### [16:00 - 17:00]

**[16:02]** the gains you get from AI decrease

**[16:02]** the gains you get from AI decrease sharply, right? And I think most code

**[16:04]** sharply, right? And I think most code

**[16:04]** sharply, right? And I think most code bases nowadays are kind of somewhere in

**[16:06]** bases nowadays are kind of somewhere in

**[16:06]** bases nowadays are kind of somewhere in the depending on on your use case,

**[16:07]** the depending on on your use case,

**[16:08]** the depending on on your use case, right? but they're bigger than a

**[16:08]** right? but they're bigger than a

**[16:08]** right? but they're bigger than a thousand lines of code unless you are a

**[16:10]** thousand lines of code unless you are a

**[16:10]** thousand lines of code unless you are a YC startup or something that's like kind

**[16:13]** YC startup or something that's like kind

**[16:13]** YC startup or something that's like kind of spun out a couple months ago, right?

**[16:15]** of spun out a couple months ago, right?

**[16:15]** of spun out a couple months ago, right? And that's because, you know, there's

**[16:17]** And that's because, you know, there's

**[16:17]** And that's because, you know, there's three three reasons for this really.

**[16:19]** three three reasons for this really.

**[16:19]** three three reasons for this really. Context window limitations. We're going

**[16:20]** Context window limitations. We're going

**[16:20]** Context window limitations. We're going to see in a second how performance

**[16:22]** to see in a second how performance

**[16:22]** to see in a second how performance decreases even with larger context

**[16:23]** decreases even with larger context

**[16:23]** decreases even with larger context windows. The signal to noise ratio is

**[16:27]** windows. The signal to noise ratio is

**[16:27]** windows. The signal to noise ratio is kind of confuses the the model if if you

**[16:29]** kind of confuses the the model if if you

**[16:29]** kind of confuses the the model if if you will. And then of course larger code

**[16:31]** will. And then of course larger code

**[16:31]** will. And then of course larger code bases have more dependencies and more

**[16:34]** bases have more dependencies and more

**[16:34]** bases have more dependencies and more domain specific logic present.

**[16:38]** domain specific logic present.

**[16:38]** domain specific logic present. And so then borrowing work from this

**[16:41]** And so then borrowing work from this

**[16:41]** And so then borrowing work from this paper called no lima which shows you on

**[16:44]** paper called no lima which shows you on

**[16:44]** paper called no lima which shows you on a scale of 0 to 100 how LLMs perform on

**[16:48]** a scale of 0 to 100 how LLMs perform on

**[16:48]** a scale of 0 to 100 how LLMs perform on coding tasks. You see that as context

**[16:51]** coding tasks. You see that as context

**[16:51]** coding tasks. You see that as context length increases from 1,00 to 32,000

**[16:54]** length increases from 1,00 to 32,000

**[16:54]** length increases from 1,00 to 32,000 tokens

**[16:56]** tokens

**[16:56]** tokens performance decreases. And so we see all

**[16:57]** performance decreases. And so we see all

**[16:57]** performance decreases. And so we see all these models here. For example, Gemini


### [17:00 - 18:00]

**[17:00]** these models here. For example, Gemini

**[17:00]** these models here. For example, Gemini 1.5 Pro has a context window of 2

**[17:02]** 1.5 Pro has a context window of 2

**[17:02]** 1.5 Pro has a context window of 2 million tokens. And you might think,

**[17:04]** million tokens. And you might think,

**[17:04]** million tokens. And you might think, whoa, I can just throw my entire

**[17:05]** whoa, I can just throw my entire

**[17:05]** whoa, I can just throw my entire codebase into it and it's going to

**[17:07]** codebase into it and it's going to

**[17:07]** codebase into it and it's going to retrieve and and code perfectly, right?

**[17:09]** retrieve and and code perfectly, right?

**[17:09]** retrieve and and code perfectly, right? And what we see is that even at 32,000

**[17:11]** And what we see is that even at 32,000

**[17:11]** And what we see is that even at 32,000 tokens, it's already showing a decrease

**[17:14]** tokens, it's already showing a decrease

**[17:14]** tokens, it's already showing a decrease in performance from 90% to about 50%.

**[17:18]** in performance from 90% to about 50%.

**[17:18]** in performance from 90% to about 50%. Right? So what's going to happen when

**[17:19]** Right? So what's going to happen when

**[17:19]** Right? So what's going to happen when you move from 32 to 64 or 128, right?

**[17:22]** you move from 32 to 64 or 128, right?

**[17:22]** you move from 32 to 64 or 128, right? You're going to see really, really poor

**[17:23]** You're going to see really, really poor

**[17:23]** You're going to see really, really poor performance here.

**[17:25]** performance here.

**[17:26]** performance here. And so in short, AI does increase

**[17:28]** And so in short, AI does increase

**[17:28]** And so in short, AI does increase developer productivity. You should use

**[17:31]** developer productivity. You should use

**[17:31]** developer productivity. You should use AI for most cases, but it doesn't

**[17:34]** AI for most cases, but it doesn't

**[17:34]** AI for most cases, but it doesn't increase the productivity of developers

**[17:37]** increase the productivity of developers

**[17:37]** increase the productivity of developers all the time and equally. It depends on

**[17:39]** all the time and equally. It depends on

**[17:39]** all the time and equally. It depends on things like task complexity, codebase

**[17:41]** things like task complexity, codebase

**[17:41]** things like task complexity, codebase maturity, language popularity, codebase

**[17:44]** maturity, language popularity, codebase

**[17:44]** maturity, language popularity, codebase size, and also context length.

**[17:48]** size, and also context length.
