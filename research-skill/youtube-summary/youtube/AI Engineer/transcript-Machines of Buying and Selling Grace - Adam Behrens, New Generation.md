**[00:17]** Hello everyone. Welcome to our talk on

**[00:17]** Hello everyone. Welcome to our talk on building AI first companies. I'm Rala

**[00:21]** building AI first companies. I'm Rala

**[00:21]** building AI first companies. I'm Rala and I'm Dibsha. We are so excited to be

**[00:23]** and I'm Dibsha. We are so excited to be

**[00:24]** and I'm Dibsha. We are so excited to be here with all of you today. Uh, you've

**[00:26]** here with all of you today. Uh, you've

**[00:26]** here with all of you today. Uh, you've probably heard the term AI first a

**[00:28]** probably heard the term AI first a

**[00:28]** probably heard the term AI first a gazillion times already this week. And

**[00:31]** gazillion times already this week. And

**[00:31]** gazillion times already this week. And if you are in this room, chances are

**[00:33]** if you are in this room, chances are

**[00:33]** if you are in this room, chances are you're not just wondering what that

**[00:35]** you're not just wondering what that

**[00:35]** you're not just wondering what that means. You're also trying to figure out

**[00:37]** means. You're also trying to figure out

**[00:37]** means. You're also trying to figure out how to actually make it real inside your

**[00:40]** how to actually make it real inside your

**[00:40]** how to actually make it real inside your own company. And that's what today's

**[00:42]** own company. And that's what today's

**[00:42]** own company. And that's what today's talk is about.

**[00:49]** We wish we could stand here and give you

**[00:49]** We wish we could stand here and give you the talk, the one with all the answers

**[00:53]** the talk, the one with all the answers

**[00:53]** the talk, the one with all the answers and a crystal clearar playbook for

**[00:55]** and a crystal clearar playbook for

**[00:55]** and a crystal clearar playbook for becoming an AI force company. But the

**[00:57]** becoming an AI force company. But the

**[00:57]** becoming an AI force company. But the truth is that that talk probably doesn't


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:00]** truth is that that talk probably doesn't

**[01:00]** truth is that that talk probably doesn't exist. AI transformation is really hard.

**[01:04]** exist. AI transformation is really hard.

**[01:04]** exist. AI transformation is really hard. It's messy. It's full of tradeoffs and

**[01:07]** It's messy. It's full of tradeoffs and

**[01:07]** It's messy. It's full of tradeoffs and it looks different for every company. At

**[01:10]** it looks different for every company. At

**[01:10]** it looks different for every company. At Sprout Social, we are in the messy

**[01:12]** Sprout Social, we are in the messy

**[01:12]** Sprout Social, we are in the messy middle of our own AI transformation. So

**[01:15]** middle of our own AI transformation. So

**[01:16]** middle of our own AI transformation. So this talk is a candid realtime look at

**[01:19]** this talk is a candid realtime look at

**[01:19]** this talk is a candid realtime look at what it takes to lead a SAS company into

**[01:22]** what it takes to lead a SAS company into

**[01:22]** what it takes to lead a SAS company into the eye era without breaking your

**[01:25]** the eye era without breaking your

**[01:25]** the eye era without breaking your business, the team or your values. We'll

**[01:28]** business, the team or your values. We'll

**[01:28]** business, the team or your values. We'll share what's working, what's not, and a

**[01:31]** share what's working, what's not, and a

**[01:31]** share what's working, what's not, and a practical framework uh to guide you

**[01:34]** practical framework uh to guide you

**[01:34]** practical framework uh to guide you through your own AI transformation. But

**[01:37]** through your own AI transformation. But

**[01:37]** through your own AI transformation. But first, let's break down the buzzword.

**[01:39]** first, let's break down the buzzword.

**[01:39]** first, let's break down the buzzword. What does AI first even mean? I feel

**[01:43]** What does AI first even mean? I feel

**[01:43]** What does AI first even mean? I feel like AI first is like teenage sex.

**[01:46]** like AI first is like teenage sex.

**[01:46]** like AI first is like teenage sex. Everyone talks about it. No one really

**[01:49]** Everyone talks about it. No one really

**[01:49]** Everyone talks about it. No one really knows how to do it. Everyone thinks

**[01:51]** knows how to do it. Everyone thinks

**[01:51]** knows how to do it. Everyone thinks everyone else is doing it, so everyone

**[01:54]** everyone else is doing it, so everyone

**[01:54]** everyone else is doing it, so everyone claims they're doing it. Jokes aside,

**[01:57]** claims they're doing it. Jokes aside,

**[01:57]** claims they're doing it. Jokes aside, what does it mean to be AI first? It's


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:00]** what does it mean to be AI first? It's

**[02:00]** what does it mean to be AI first? It's about evolving from AI features

**[02:03]** about evolving from AI features

**[02:03]** about evolving from AI features sprinkled into the product to rethinking

**[02:07]** sprinkled into the product to rethinking

**[02:07]** sprinkled into the product to rethinking how you plan, build, and deliver value

**[02:11]** how you plan, build, and deliver value

**[02:11]** how you plan, build, and deliver value all through an AI lens. More than that,

**[02:15]** all through an AI lens. More than that,

**[02:15]** all through an AI lens. More than that, it's about putting AI at the center of

**[02:18]** it's about putting AI at the center of

**[02:18]** it's about putting AI at the center of your strategy. But most importantly,

**[02:21]** your strategy. But most importantly,

**[02:21]** your strategy. But most importantly, it's a mindset shift more than anything

**[02:24]** it's a mindset shift more than anything

**[02:24]** it's a mindset shift more than anything else.

**[02:25]** else.

**[02:26]** else. Now, if you've been in tech for a while,

**[02:28]** Now, if you've been in tech for a while,

**[02:28]** Now, if you've been in tech for a while, you've seen big shifts before. Cloud

**[02:31]** you've seen big shifts before. Cloud

**[02:31]** you've seen big shifts before. Cloud first, mobile first, DevOps, and many

**[02:34]** first, mobile first, DevOps, and many

**[02:34]** first, mobile first, DevOps, and many more. But here's the difference. Those

**[02:37]** more. But here's the difference. Those

**[02:37]** more. But here's the difference. Those shifts disrupted one area at a time. AI

**[02:42]** shifts disrupted one area at a time. AI

**[02:42]** shifts disrupted one area at a time. AI is disrupting all of them at once. Its

**[02:46]** is disrupting all of them at once. Its

**[02:46]** is disrupting all of them at once. Its product, its architecture, its people,

**[02:49]** product, its architecture, its people,

**[02:49]** product, its architecture, its people, its process, its ethics, its everything.

**[02:54]** its process, its ethics, its everything.

**[02:54]** its process, its ethics, its everything. And that's what makes it so hard, but

**[02:56]** And that's what makes it so hard, but

**[02:56]** And that's what makes it so hard, but also such a gamecher.

**[02:59]** also such a gamecher.

**[02:59]** also such a gamecher. Here's the good news. Being AI first


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:02]** Here's the good news. Being AI first

**[03:02]** Here's the good news. Being AI first isn't binary. It's not like flipping a

**[03:05]** isn't binary. It's not like flipping a

**[03:05]** isn't binary. It's not like flipping a switch. It's not about throwing

**[03:07]** switch. It's not about throwing

**[03:08]** switch. It's not about throwing everything out and rebuilding your

**[03:09]** everything out and rebuilding your

**[03:09]** everything out and rebuilding your company overnight. AI transformation is

**[03:12]** company overnight. AI transformation is

**[03:12]** company overnight. AI transformation is a multi-dimensional journey. It's an

**[03:15]** a multi-dimensional journey. It's an

**[03:15]** a multi-dimensional journey. It's an evolution.

**[03:16]** evolution.

**[03:16]** evolution. Where you are on this spectrum will vary

**[03:19]** Where you are on this spectrum will vary

**[03:19]** Where you are on this spectrum will vary depending on your own company. But the

**[03:22]** depending on your own company. But the

**[03:22]** depending on your own company. But the important thing is to know where you are

**[03:24]** important thing is to know where you are

**[03:24]** important thing is to know where you are and to move with purpose.

**[03:28]** and to move with purpose.

**[03:28]** and to move with purpose. AI transformation is complex, but it

**[03:31]** AI transformation is complex, but it

**[03:31]** AI transformation is complex, but it doesn't have to feel chaotic. At Sprout

**[03:34]** doesn't have to feel chaotic. At Sprout

**[03:34]** doesn't have to feel chaotic. At Sprout Social, we found that it helps to think

**[03:37]** Social, we found that it helps to think

**[03:37]** Social, we found that it helps to think about it through a simple framework. At

**[03:39]** about it through a simple framework. At

**[03:39]** about it through a simple framework. At its core, becoming an AI first company

**[03:42]** its core, becoming an AI first company

**[03:42]** its core, becoming an AI first company means evolving across three key

**[03:45]** means evolving across three key

**[03:45]** means evolving across three key dimensions. Strategy, what you

**[03:47]** dimensions. Strategy, what you

**[03:47]** dimensions. Strategy, what you prioritize and why. ways of working, how

**[03:51]** prioritize and why. ways of working, how

**[03:51]** prioritize and why. ways of working, how you build, ship, and adapt, and people,

**[03:55]** you build, ship, and adapt, and people,

**[03:55]** you build, ship, and adapt, and people, how your teams evolve, and the skills

**[03:58]** how your teams evolve, and the skills

**[03:58]** how your teams evolve, and the skills that define success.


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:00]** that define success.

**[04:00]** that define success. Whether you're just getting started or

**[04:02]** Whether you're just getting started or

**[04:02]** Whether you're just getting started or already in the thick of it, these three

**[04:05]** already in the thick of it, these three

**[04:05]** already in the thick of it, these three areas give a way to make sense of the

**[04:08]** areas give a way to make sense of the

**[04:08]** areas give a way to make sense of the work that is ahead of you. And we hope

**[04:10]** work that is ahead of you. And we hope

**[04:10]** work that is ahead of you. And we hope that this simple framework can help you

**[04:12]** that this simple framework can help you

**[04:12]** that this simple framework can help you navigate your own AI transformation.

**[04:15]** navigate your own AI transformation.

**[04:15]** navigate your own AI transformation. So now that we set the bigger picture,

**[04:18]** So now that we set the bigger picture,

**[04:18]** So now that we set the bigger picture, let's start with the first dimension

**[04:20]** let's start with the first dimension

**[04:20]** let's start with the first dimension strategy.

**[04:22]** strategy.

**[04:22]** strategy. The very first critical shift is about

**[04:25]** The very first critical shift is about

**[04:25]** The very first critical shift is about how to determine what to build about

**[04:28]** how to determine what to build about

**[04:28]** how to determine what to build about evolving from an AI enhanced to an AI

**[04:32]** evolving from an AI enhanced to an AI

**[04:32]** evolving from an AI enhanced to an AI first strategy where you are reimagining

**[04:36]** first strategy where you are reimagining

**[04:36]** first strategy where you are reimagining what's possible today thanks to AI. In

**[04:39]** what's possible today thanks to AI. In

**[04:40]** what's possible today thanks to AI. In the past, investing in AI meant asking

**[04:43]** the past, investing in AI meant asking

**[04:43]** the past, investing in AI meant asking where can we add intelligence to an

**[04:46]** where can we add intelligence to an

**[04:46]** where can we add intelligence to an existing experience. It was about

**[04:48]** existing experience. It was about

**[04:48]** existing experience. It was about sprinkling AI across your product to

**[04:51]** sprinkling AI across your product to

**[04:51]** sprinkling AI across your product to make workflows better. In contrast, in

**[04:55]** make workflows better. In contrast, in

**[04:55]** make workflows better. In contrast, in an AI first company, the question

**[04:57]** an AI first company, the question

**[04:57]** an AI first company, the question becomes, what new experiences can we


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:01]** becomes, what new experiences can we

**[05:01]** becomes, what new experiences can we deliver that weren't even possible

**[05:03]** deliver that weren't even possible

**[05:03]** deliver that weren't even possible before?

**[05:04]** before?

**[05:04]** before? Being AI first means reimagining what's

**[05:08]** Being AI first means reimagining what's

**[05:08]** Being AI first means reimagining what's possible. It's about solving problems

**[05:11]** possible. It's about solving problems

**[05:11]** possible. It's about solving problems that were previously unsolvable in ways

**[05:14]** that were previously unsolvable in ways

**[05:14]** that were previously unsolvable in ways that customers may not even imagine.

**[05:18]** that customers may not even imagine.

**[05:18]** that customers may not even imagine. Now, dreaming about the future is super

**[05:20]** Now, dreaming about the future is super

**[05:20]** Now, dreaming about the future is super fun, but the challenge is that you still

**[05:23]** fun, but the challenge is that you still

**[05:23]** fun, but the challenge is that you still have to ship features to meet your

**[05:26]** have to ship features to meet your

**[05:26]** have to ship features to meet your customer needs today. That's the tension

**[05:30]** customer needs today. That's the tension

**[05:30]** customer needs today. That's the tension every company is facing right now. How

**[05:33]** every company is facing right now. How

**[05:33]** every company is facing right now. How do you ship what customer needs today

**[05:35]** do you ship what customer needs today

**[05:35]** do you ship what customer needs today while also investing in the future you

**[05:38]** while also investing in the future you

**[05:38]** while also investing in the future you know is coming? If you overindex on the

**[05:41]** know is coming? If you overindex on the

**[05:41]** know is coming? If you overindex on the present, you risk falling behind and

**[05:44]** present, you risk falling behind and

**[05:44]** present, you risk falling behind and missing the moment. If you focus only on

**[05:47]** missing the moment. If you focus only on

**[05:47]** missing the moment. If you focus only on the future, you risk disappointing

**[05:50]** the future, you risk disappointing

**[05:50]** the future, you risk disappointing customers, slowing revenue, and

**[05:52]** customers, slowing revenue, and

**[05:52]** customers, slowing revenue, and potentially starving innovation of

**[05:54]** potentially starving innovation of

**[05:54]** potentially starving innovation of resources.

**[05:56]** resources.

**[05:56]** resources. That's the core of the innovator's

**[05:57]** That's the core of the innovator's

**[05:57]** That's the core of the innovator's dilemma. And AI makes it 10 times


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:00]** dilemma. And AI makes it 10 times

**[06:00]** dilemma. And AI makes it 10 times harder. You basically need the

**[06:03]** harder. You basically need the

**[06:03]** harder. You basically need the discipline of an enterprise and the

**[06:06]** discipline of an enterprise and the

**[06:06]** discipline of an enterprise and the curiosity and nimleness of a startup,

**[06:09]** curiosity and nimleness of a startup,

**[06:10]** curiosity and nimleness of a startup, but you need both to be running in

**[06:12]** but you need both to be running in

**[06:12]** but you need both to be running in parallel. It's like steering a ship and

**[06:16]** parallel. It's like steering a ship and

**[06:16]** parallel. It's like steering a ship and launching a rocket at the same time. So,

**[06:19]** launching a rocket at the same time. So,

**[06:20]** launching a rocket at the same time. So, at some point, you have to figure out

**[06:22]** at some point, you have to figure out

**[06:22]** at some point, you have to figure out how to build a startup inside your own

**[06:25]** how to build a startup inside your own

**[06:26]** how to build a startup inside your own company.

**[06:27]** company.

**[06:27]** company. I couldn't agree more and that is what

**[06:29]** I couldn't agree more and that is what

**[06:29]** I couldn't agree more and that is what makes this so difficult with this fast

**[06:32]** makes this so difficult with this fast

**[06:32]** makes this so difficult with this fast evolving goal for goalpost if you felt

**[06:34]** evolving goal for goalpost if you felt

**[06:34]** evolving goal for goalpost if you felt this tension you're not alone when a

**[06:36]** this tension you're not alone when a

**[06:36]** this tension you're not alone when a three month road map starts to feel

**[06:38]** three month road map starts to feel

**[06:38]** three month road map starts to feel stale in 3 week what is possible is

**[06:41]** stale in 3 week what is possible is

**[06:41]** stale in 3 week what is possible is constantly evolving how do you adjust

**[06:44]** constantly evolving how do you adjust

**[06:44]** constantly evolving how do you adjust that in the road map and because of that

**[06:47]** that in the road map and because of that

**[06:47]** that in the road map and because of that we're realizing that we're moving

**[06:49]** we're realizing that we're moving

**[06:49]** we're realizing that we're moving farther from deterministic road maps

**[06:51]** farther from deterministic road maps

**[06:51]** farther from deterministic road maps where we generally knew what we were

**[06:53]** where we generally knew what we were

**[06:53]** where we generally knew what we were building for months in advance we've had

**[06:55]** building for months in advance we've had

**[06:55]** building for months in advance we've had to shift our mindset that embraces

**[06:57]** to shift our mindset that embraces

**[06:57]** to shift our mindset that embraces ambiguity where learning and discovery


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:00]** ambiguity where learning and discovery

**[07:00]** ambiguity where learning and discovery are what shaped the path forward. Now

**[07:03]** are what shaped the path forward. Now

**[07:03]** are what shaped the path forward. Now the destination itself can evolve as we

**[07:06]** the destination itself can evolve as we

**[07:06]** the destination itself can evolve as we learn more about what's possible

**[07:09]** learn more about what's possible

**[07:09]** learn more about what's possible and that's how we plan. It's also

**[07:11]** and that's how we plan. It's also

**[07:11]** and that's how we plan. It's also evolved how we design when earlier we

**[07:14]** evolved how we design when earlier we

**[07:14]** evolved how we design when earlier we could build AI into features in an AI

**[07:17]** could build AI into features in an AI

**[07:17]** could build AI into features in an AI first interaction. Customers expect

**[07:19]** first interaction. Customers expect

**[07:20]** first interaction. Customers expect seamless intelligent systems that

**[07:22]** seamless intelligent systems that

**[07:22]** seamless intelligent systems that stretch across workflows and even roles.

**[07:26]** stretch across workflows and even roles.

**[07:26]** stretch across workflows and even roles. Let's think through that with an

**[07:27]** Let's think through that with an

**[07:27]** Let's think through that with an example. Let's talk about Wufill. It's a

**[07:30]** example. Let's talk about Wufill. It's a

**[07:30]** example. Let's talk about Wufill. It's a health tracking app for puppies. And

**[07:33]** health tracking app for puppies. And

**[07:33]** health tracking app for puppies. And here our customer is Pineapples.

**[07:35]** here our customer is Pineapples.

**[07:35]** here our customer is Pineapples. Pineapples uses Wufill to track meals uh

**[07:39]** Pineapples uses Wufill to track meals uh

**[07:39]** Pineapples uses Wufill to track meals uh activities, digestive insights. Yes,

**[07:41]** activities, digestive insights. Yes,

**[07:41]** activities, digestive insights. Yes, that's a pool blog. And also track

**[07:44]** that's a pool blog. And also track

**[07:44]** that's a pool blog. And also track supplement recommendations.

**[07:46]** supplement recommendations.

**[07:46]** supplement recommendations. Each of these features in our company is

**[07:49]** Each of these features in our company is

**[07:49]** Each of these features in our company is owned by different teams. But in an AI

**[07:51]** owned by different teams. But in an AI

**[07:52]** owned by different teams. But in an AI first world, when Pineapples is engaging

**[07:54]** first world, when Pineapples is engaging

**[07:54]** first world, when Pineapples is engaging with that app in a natural language,

**[07:56]** with that app in a natural language,

**[07:56]** with that app in a natural language, he's not thinking in features. He's

**[07:58]** he's not thinking in features. He's

**[07:58]** he's not thinking in features. He's expecting a unified value. So when


### [08:00 - 09:00]

**[08:00]** expecting a unified value. So when

**[08:00]** expecting a unified value. So when Pineapple says, "I'm feeling kind of

**[08:03]** Pineapple says, "I'm feeling kind of

**[08:03]** Pineapple says, "I'm feeling kind of blah." A meal-based response could say,

**[08:05]** blah." A meal-based response could say,

**[08:05]** blah." A meal-based response could say, "Hey, maybe because you skipped

**[08:07]** "Hey, maybe because you skipped

**[08:07]** "Hey, maybe because you skipped breakfast," a digestive based response

**[08:09]** breakfast," a digestive based response

**[08:10]** breakfast," a digestive based response could say, "Yeah, your poop seemed a

**[08:11]** could say, "Yeah, your poop seemed a

**[08:11]** could say, "Yeah, your poop seemed a little off today." But both both answers

**[08:14]** little off today." But both both answers

**[08:14]** little off today." But both both answers are useful, but very narrow. Now imagine

**[08:17]** are useful, but very narrow. Now imagine

**[08:17]** are useful, but very narrow. Now imagine a unified experience for pineapples. The

**[08:21]** a unified experience for pineapples. The

**[08:21]** a unified experience for pineapples. The answer could be it might be the new

**[08:23]** answer could be it might be the new

**[08:23]** answer could be it might be the new kibble. Your activity seems to be going

**[08:25]** kibble. Your activity seems to be going

**[08:25]** kibble. Your activity seems to be going down over the days and your poop also

**[08:27]** down over the days and your poop also

**[08:27]** down over the days and your poop also seemed to be off today. Maybe this new

**[08:29]** seemed to be off today. Maybe this new

**[08:30]** seemed to be off today. Maybe this new supplement that you're trying. Pause it

**[08:31]** supplement that you're trying. Pause it

**[08:31]** supplement that you're trying. Pause it and see how you feel tomorrow. That's

**[08:34]** and see how you feel tomorrow. That's

**[08:34]** and see how you feel tomorrow. That's what AI first really means. Not just

**[08:36]** what AI first really means. Not just

**[08:36]** what AI first really means. Not just smarter features with AI sprinkled in
