**[00:18]** the number of agents in the world I

**[00:18]** the number of agents in the world I believe won't just match number of

**[00:19]** believe won't just match number of

**[00:19]** believe won't just match number of humans but they will basically be the

**[00:21]** humans but they will basically be the

**[00:21]** humans but they will basically be the number of humans to the power of n and

**[00:24]** number of humans to the power of n and

**[00:24]** number of humans to the power of n and what is the power of n I have really no

**[00:26]** what is the power of n I have really no

**[00:26]** what is the power of n I have really no idea but we can see already today that

**[00:29]** idea but we can see already today that

**[00:29]** idea but we can see already today that we are using multiple of them more are

**[00:31]** we are using multiple of them more are

**[00:31]** we are using multiple of them more are spinning up more and so it will be a

**[00:33]** spinning up more and so it will be a

**[00:34]** spinning up more and so it will be a very very large number and this isn't

**[00:37]** very very large number and this isn't

**[00:37]** very very large number and this isn't just hypothetical I mean we don't have a

**[00:40]** just hypothetical I mean we don't have a

**[00:40]** just hypothetical I mean we don't have a lot of data around this I actually

**[00:41]** lot of data around this I actually

**[00:41]** lot of data around this I actually researched a lot and try to find what we

**[00:43]** researched a lot and try to find what we

**[00:43]** researched a lot and try to find what we have but the some key elements that we

**[00:45]** have but the some key elements that we

**[00:45]** have but the some key elements that we do have is that the first one maybe not

**[00:48]** do have is that the first one maybe not

**[00:48]** do have is that the first one maybe not that important but 25% of YC startups

**[00:50]** that important but 25% of YC startups

**[00:50]** that important but 25% of YC startups say that AI writes 95% of their code but

**[00:54]** say that AI writes 95% of their code but

**[00:54]** say that AI writes 95% of their code but the second part is actually quite

**[00:55]** the second part is actually quite

**[00:55]** the second part is actually quite interesting whereas 37% of the latest YC

**[00:59]** interesting whereas 37% of the latest YC

**[00:59]** interesting whereas 37% of the latest YC batch are actually building agents as


### [01:00 - 02:00]

**[01:01]** batch are actually building agents as

**[01:01]** batch are actually building agents as their products. So they're not building

**[01:02]** their products. So they're not building

**[01:02]** their products. So they're not building co-pilots, they're not building

**[01:03]** co-pilots, they're not building

**[01:03]** co-pilots, they're not building autocomplete, they're not building

**[01:05]** autocomplete, they're not building

**[01:05]** autocomplete, they're not building legacy SAS companies. Like agents are

**[01:07]** legacy SAS companies. Like agents are

**[01:07]** legacy SAS companies. Like agents are the new product.

**[01:09]** the new product.

**[01:10]** the new product. And I think that's actually quite

**[01:11]** And I think that's actually quite

**[01:11]** And I think that's actually quite interesting and aligns with what we're

**[01:13]** interesting and aligns with what we're

**[01:13]** interesting and aligns with what we're looking at. But the most uncomfortable

**[01:15]** looking at. But the most uncomfortable

**[01:15]** looking at. But the most uncomfortable truth for people building tools for

**[01:17]** truth for people building tools for

**[01:17]** truth for people building tools for agents which we are and I know a lot of

**[01:19]** agents which we are and I know a lot of

**[01:19]** agents which we are and I know a lot of people are as well is that most of the

**[01:21]** people are as well is that most of the

**[01:21]** people are as well is that most of the tools that are built today

**[01:24]** tools that are built today

**[01:24]** tools that are built today uh break the the moment you remove a

**[01:27]** uh break the the moment you remove a

**[01:27]** uh break the the moment you remove a human from the loop

**[01:30]** human from the loop

**[01:30]** human from the loop as we're not entering a world where like

**[01:32]** as we're not entering a world where like

**[01:32]** as we're not entering a world where like agents are assisting developers. Agents

**[01:34]** agents are assisting developers. Agents

**[01:34]** agents are assisting developers. Agents will definitely be the developers. I

**[01:36]** will definitely be the developers. I

**[01:36]** will definitely be the developers. I mean they will be the number one people

**[01:38]** mean they will be the number one people

**[01:38]** mean they will be the number one people using that. So basically,

**[01:47]** if you're not building dev tools,

**[01:47]** if you're not building dev tools, if you're building dev tools for humans,

**[01:49]** if you're building dev tools for humans,

**[01:49]** if you're building dev tools for humans, you're basically building for the past.

**[01:51]** you're basically building for the past.

**[01:51]** you're basically building for the past. And what I think about when we build our

**[01:54]** And what I think about when we build our

**[01:54]** And what I think about when we build our things, and I think we all should do is

**[01:55]** things, and I think we all should do is

**[01:55]** things, and I think we all should do is like what does it mean to actually build

**[01:57]** like what does it mean to actually build

**[01:57]** like what does it mean to actually build tools for the future? And I think it


### [02:00 - 03:00]

**[02:01]** tools for the future? And I think it

**[02:01]** tools for the future? And I think it means building for agents. And the term

**[02:04]** means building for agents. And the term

**[02:04]** means building for agents. And the term for building for agents um is agent

**[02:07]** for building for agents um is agent

**[02:07]** for building for agents um is agent experience. And a good friend of mine,

**[02:08]** experience. And a good friend of mine,

**[02:08]** experience. And a good friend of mine, Matt, which I guess a lot of you know

**[02:09]** Matt, which I guess a lot of you know

**[02:10]** Matt, which I guess a lot of you know here, who's the co-founder of Netifi,

**[02:12]** here, who's the co-founder of Netifi,

**[02:12]** here, who's the co-founder of Netifi, coined the term agent experience. And

**[02:14]** coined the term agent experience. And

**[02:14]** coined the term agent experience. And it's supposed to be or continues the

**[02:17]** it's supposed to be or continues the

**[02:17]** it's supposed to be or continues the evolution of like a user experience, a

**[02:18]** evolution of like a user experience, a

**[02:18]** evolution of like a user experience, a customer experience. And most mostly a

**[02:21]** customer experience. And most mostly a

**[02:21]** customer experience. And most mostly a developer experience. But the division

**[02:23]** developer experience. But the division

**[02:23]** developer experience. But the division the definition that I sort of found that

**[02:25]** the definition that I sort of found that

**[02:25]** the definition that I sort of found that works the best or defines it the best

**[02:27]** works the best or defines it the best

**[02:28]** works the best or defines it the best was the one from Sean that works at

**[02:29]** was the one from Sean that works at

**[02:30]** was the one from Sean that works at netlefi. not M not necessarily which

**[02:32]** netlefi. not M not necessarily which

**[02:32]** netlefi. not M not necessarily which says how easily can agents access how

**[02:36]** says how easily can agents access how

**[02:36]** says how easily can agents access how easily can they understand and how

**[02:38]** easily can they understand and how

**[02:38]** easily can they understand and how easily can they operate within digital

**[02:40]** easily can they operate within digital

**[02:40]** easily can they operate within digital environments to achieve the goal that

**[02:43]** environments to achieve the goal that

**[02:43]** environments to achieve the goal that the user defined

**[02:45]** the user defined

**[02:45]** the user defined and I think that's a really good

**[02:47]** and I think that's a really good

**[02:47]** and I think that's a really good definition and looking at this I wanted

**[02:50]** definition and looking at this I wanted

**[02:50]** definition and looking at this I wanted to see like who is actually implementing

**[02:52]** to see like who is actually implementing

**[02:52]** to see like who is actually implementing agent experience who is looking at this

**[02:54]** agent experience who is looking at this

**[02:54]** agent experience who is looking at this definition is who is building their

**[02:55]** definition is who is building their

**[02:55]** definition is who is building their tools like this and I found some

**[02:58]** tools like this and I found some

**[02:58]** tools like this and I found some companies and there's more than the ones

**[02:59]** companies and there's more than the ones

**[02:59]** companies and there's more than the ones I put in here of course. So like if you


### [03:00 - 04:00]

**[03:01]** I put in here of course. So like if you

**[03:01]** I put in here of course. So like if you guys are building something like this

**[03:02]** guys are building something like this

**[03:02]** guys are building something like this and I didn't put you, I'm very very

**[03:03]** and I didn't put you, I'm very very

**[03:03]** and I didn't put you, I'm very very sorry. Like I just wanted to put a few

**[03:05]** sorry. Like I just wanted to put a few

**[03:05]** sorry. Like I just wanted to put a few that I've talked to and looked at. And

**[03:07]** that I've talked to and looked at. And

**[03:07]** that I've talked to and looked at. And so I think seamless authentification is

**[03:10]** so I think seamless authentification is

**[03:10]** so I think seamless authentification is a really really important one. Um and if

**[03:14]** a really really important one. Um and if

**[03:14]** a really really important one. Um and if your agent if you give an agent a task

**[03:16]** your agent if you give an agent a task

**[03:16]** your agent if you give an agent a task to do when it has to log in for the most

**[03:18]** to do when it has to log in for the most

**[03:18]** to do when it has to log in for the most part it will break. And moreover you

**[03:20]** part it will break. And moreover you

**[03:20]** part it will break. And moreover you don't want to give your passwords to the

**[03:21]** don't want to give your passwords to the

**[03:21]** don't want to give your passwords to the agent. That is definitely not a good

**[03:23]** agent. That is definitely not a good

**[03:23]** agent. That is definitely not a good idea. And so company a company like

**[03:26]** idea. And so company a company like

**[03:26]** idea. And so company a company like Arcade which randomly if he's around I

**[03:29]** Arcade which randomly if he's around I

**[03:29]** Arcade which randomly if he's around I met the founder yesterday I had not met

**[03:30]** met the founder yesterday I had not met

**[03:30]** met the founder yesterday I had not met him before that he was ready in the talk

**[03:32]** him before that he was ready in the talk

**[03:32]** him before that he was ready in the talk um what they solve is if your agent

**[03:35]** um what they solve is if your agent

**[03:35]** um what they solve is if your agent tries to au authenticate into like Delta

**[03:38]** tries to au authenticate into like Delta

**[03:38]** tries to au authenticate into like Delta or Booking.com or wherever it is it can

**[03:41]** or Booking.com or wherever it is it can

**[03:41]** or Booking.com or wherever it is it can fall back to the user the user can log

**[03:43]** fall back to the user the user can log

**[03:43]** fall back to the user the user can log in and the agent can go off to its job

**[03:46]** in and the agent can go off to its job

**[03:46]** in and the agent can go off to its job moreover you can also add credentials

**[03:48]** moreover you can also add credentials

**[03:48]** moreover you can also add credentials inside of arcade before that so your

**[03:50]** inside of arcade before that so your

**[03:50]** inside of arcade before that so your agent can go and do what it's mean to be

**[03:53]** agent can go and do what it's mean to be

**[03:53]** agent can go and do what it's mean to be done so authenticate once agent goes off

**[03:56]** done so authenticate once agent goes off

**[03:56]** done so authenticate once agent goes off does their job. A second one is this is

**[03:59]** does their job. A second one is this is

**[03:59]** does their job. A second one is this is the most this easiest one which I'm sure


### [04:00 - 05:00]

**[04:01]** the most this easiest one which I'm sure

**[04:01]** the most this easiest one which I'm sure pretty much all of you do here is agent

**[04:03]** pretty much all of you do here is agent

**[04:03]** pretty much all of you do here is agent readable docs and stripe does a great

**[04:05]** readable docs and stripe does a great

**[04:05]** readable docs and stripe does a great job of this. Basically any doc URL just

**[04:07]** job of this. Basically any doc URL just

**[04:07]** job of this. Basically any doc URL just appended md and you'll get a clean

**[04:11]** appended md and you'll get a clean

**[04:11]** appended md and you'll get a clean markdown file no fluff the agent can

**[04:13]** markdown file no fluff the agent can

**[04:13]** markdown file no fluff the agent can consume it as easy as very very easily.

**[04:16]** consume it as easy as very very easily.

**[04:16]** consume it as easy as very very easily. Um but moreover the llm's.txt standard

**[04:19]** Um but moreover the llm's.txt standard

**[04:19]** Um but moreover the llm's.txt standard I'm sure all of you have seen it. It's

**[04:20]** I'm sure all of you have seen it. It's

**[04:20]** I'm sure all of you have seen it. It's actually on the website as you can get

**[04:22]** actually on the website as you can get

**[04:22]** actually on the website as you can get um the conference website. So if you

**[04:24]** um the conference website. So if you

**[04:24]** um the conference website. So if you don't have an LM llm's.txt in your docs,

**[04:27]** don't have an LM llm's.txt in your docs,

**[04:27]** don't have an LM llm's.txt in your docs, you definitely should. Makes it super

**[04:28]** you definitely should. Makes it super

**[04:28]** you definitely should. Makes it super easy for the agent to go um and read

**[04:31]** easy for the agent to go um and read

**[04:31]** easy for the agent to go um and read what you all are doing.

**[04:34]** what you all are doing.

**[04:34]** what you all are doing. The third thing we found was API first

**[04:36]** The third thing we found was API first

**[04:36]** The third thing we found was API first design. And I think this is actually the

**[04:38]** design. And I think this is actually the

**[04:38]** design. And I think this is actually the most critical. Um basically if an agent

**[04:41]** most critical. Um basically if an agent

**[04:41]** most critical. Um basically if an agent can't see the functionality, it's really

**[04:42]** can't see the functionality, it's really

**[04:42]** can't see the functionality, it's really hard for it to do. And I strongly

**[04:45]** hard for it to do. And I strongly

**[04:45]** hard for it to do. And I strongly believe that the best way for an agent

**[04:48]** believe that the best way for an agent

**[04:48]** believe that the best way for an agent to interact with any tool is through a

**[04:50]** to interact with any tool is through a

**[04:50]** to interact with any tool is through a machine native interface. And I put API

**[04:53]** machine native interface. And I put API

**[04:53]** machine native interface. And I put API here and I won't talk about MCP. I'm

**[04:55]** here and I won't talk about MCP. I'm

**[04:55]** here and I won't talk about MCP. I'm sure a lot of people talk about MCP.

**[04:57]** sure a lot of people talk about MCP.

**[04:57]** sure a lot of people talk about MCP. Will MCP be here or not here? I don't

**[04:59]** Will MCP be here or not here? I don't

**[04:59]** Will MCP be here or not here? I don't know. But basically an API is the


### [05:00 - 06:00]

**[05:02]** know. But basically an API is the

**[05:02]** know. But basically an API is the underlying tech that you have to have

**[05:04]** underlying tech that you have to have

**[05:04]** underlying tech that you have to have have to be exposed so the agent can

**[05:06]** have to be exposed so the agent can

**[05:06]** have to be exposed so the agent can access uh what they want the most

**[05:08]** access uh what they want the most

**[05:08]** access uh what they want the most efficiently.

**[05:10]** efficiently.

**[05:10]** efficiently. And so Neon and ETFI and Superbase and

**[05:14]** And so Neon and ETFI and Superbase and

**[05:14]** And so Neon and ETFI and Superbase and these companies do this a really good

**[05:15]** these companies do this a really good

**[05:15]** these companies do this a really good job of this. As far as I know, like all

**[05:17]** job of this. As far as I know, like all

**[05:17]** job of this. As far as I know, like all the key things that an agent needs to

**[05:19]** the key things that an agent needs to

**[05:19]** the key things that an agent needs to use their services can be accessed via

**[05:21]** use their services can be accessed via

**[05:21]** use their services can be accessed via an API.

**[05:23]** an API.

**[05:23]** an API. And now all these things are really

**[05:25]** And now all these things are really

**[05:25]** And now all these things are really great and I think this is all a right

**[05:27]** great and I think this is all a right

**[05:27]** great and I think this is all a right direction. But is there more? Is that

**[05:29]** direction. But is there more? Is that

**[05:29]** direction. But is there more? Is that it? Is like is it just an API? Is it

**[05:31]** it? Is like is it just an API? Is it

**[05:31]** it? Is like is it just an API? Is it just like a make your docs more

**[05:32]** just like a make your docs more

**[05:32]** just like a make your docs more readable? Um

**[05:35]** readable? Um

**[05:35]** readable? Um and so what I wanted to think about is

**[05:36]** and so what I wanted to think about is

**[05:36]** and so what I wanted to think about is the first definition of Shaun's and I

**[05:38]** the first definition of Shaun's and I

**[05:38]** the first definition of Shaun's and I think there's missing one key part for

**[05:40]** think there's missing one key part for

**[05:40]** think there's missing one key part for all of us who are building tools to

**[05:41]** all of us who are building tools to

**[05:41]** all of us who are building tools to think about. Um and that's the word

**[05:44]** think about. Um and that's the word

**[05:44]** think about. Um and that's the word actually autonomously.

**[05:46]** actually autonomously.

**[05:46]** actually autonomously. So how easily can an agent autonomously

**[05:48]** So how easily can an agent autonomously

**[05:48]** So how easily can an agent autonomously access, autonomously understand,

**[05:50]** access, autonomously understand,

**[05:50]** access, autonomously understand, autonomously operate within this

**[05:51]** autonomously operate within this

**[05:51]** autonomously operate within this environment? And I think this word is

**[05:54]** environment? And I think this word is

**[05:54]** environment? And I think this word is actually quite important and it makes

**[05:56]** actually quite important and it makes

**[05:56]** actually quite important and it makes you sort of think about what you're

**[05:57]** you sort of think about what you're

**[05:57]** you sort of think about what you're doing in a different way because if you


### [06:00 - 07:00]

**[06:01]** doing in a different way because if you

**[06:01]** doing in a different way because if you know you give your agent a task and it

**[06:03]** know you give your agent a task and it

**[06:03]** know you give your agent a task and it can do a lot but it always has to fall

**[06:05]** can do a lot but it always has to fall

**[06:05]** can do a lot but it always has to fall back to you to achieve its task. I don't

**[06:07]** back to you to achieve its task. I don't

**[06:07]** back to you to achieve its task. I don't think that is the future and I think we

**[06:11]** think that is the future and I think we

**[06:11]** think that is the future and I think we should all go back to the drawing board

**[06:13]** should all go back to the drawing board

**[06:13]** should all go back to the drawing board and think about this basically. you know

**[06:15]** and think about this basically. you know

**[06:15]** and think about this basically. you know what happens if there are no humans

**[06:17]** what happens if there are no humans

**[06:17]** what happens if there are no humans around to click the buttons to debug

**[06:19]** around to click the buttons to debug

**[06:19]** around to click the buttons to debug errors to whatever it may be I think

**[06:21]** errors to whatever it may be I think

**[06:21]** errors to whatever it may be I think that's where our work starts as tool

**[06:23]** that's where our work starts as tool

**[06:23]** that's where our work starts as tool builders like

**[06:26]** builders like

**[06:26]** builders like and so if you're not actually solving

**[06:27]** and so if you're not actually solving

**[06:27]** and so if you're not actually solving that then I actually think you are just

**[06:29]** that then I actually think you are just

**[06:29]** that then I actually think you are just porting for the past and just as a note

**[06:32]** porting for the past and just as a note

**[06:32]** porting for the past and just as a note um

**[06:34]** um

**[06:34]** um Swix basically um coerced me into doing

**[06:37]** Swix basically um coerced me into doing

**[06:37]** Swix basically um coerced me into doing this talk because he said that devel

**[06:38]** this talk because he said that devel

**[06:38]** this talk because he said that devel that agent experience doesn't exist it's

**[06:40]** that agent experience doesn't exist it's

**[06:40]** that agent experience doesn't exist it's just a wraparound developer experience

**[06:42]** just a wraparound developer experience

**[06:42]** just a wraparound developer experience and so I think if you're not thinking

**[06:44]** and so I think if you're not thinking

**[06:44]** and so I think if you're not thinking about how an agent can autonomously do

**[06:47]** about how an agent can autonomously do

**[06:47]** about how an agent can autonomously do his task, then you basically are doing

**[06:48]** his task, then you basically are doing

**[06:48]** his task, then you basically are doing that. And I don't think everyone's doing

**[06:50]** that. And I don't think everyone's doing

**[06:50]** that. And I don't think everyone's doing that. Um, and just really quickly, I

**[06:52]** that. Um, and just really quickly, I

**[06:52]** that. Um, and just really quickly, I sort of skipped off who I am and why the

**[06:53]** sort of skipped off who I am and why the

**[06:53]** sort of skipped off who I am and why the hell I'm talking about these things. Um,

**[06:55]** hell I'm talking about these things. Um,

**[06:55]** hell I'm talking about these things. Um, and why I might know something, might

**[06:57]** and why I might know something, might

**[06:57]** and why I might know something, might not. Well, we'll see at the end of it.

**[06:59]** not. Well, we'll see at the end of it.

**[06:59]** not. Well, we'll see at the end of it. So, first company in the early 2000s, so


### [07:00 - 08:00]

**[07:02]** So, first company in the early 2000s, so

**[07:02]** So, first company in the early 2000s, so am dated, very old person. Um, started

**[07:05]** am dated, very old person. Um, started

**[07:05]** am dated, very old person. Um, started by building like data centers and server

**[07:07]** by building like data centers and server

**[07:07]** by building like data centers and server rooms, HP servers, IBM's, hypervisor,

**[07:09]** rooms, HP servers, IBM's, hypervisor,

**[07:10]** rooms, HP servers, IBM's, hypervisor, VMware, all these things. So actually

**[07:11]** VMware, all these things. So actually

**[07:11]** VMware, all these things. So actually screwing in servers and running cables

**[07:14]** screwing in servers and running cables

**[07:14]** screwing in servers and running cables and and installing Windows servers via

**[07:16]** and and installing Windows servers via

**[07:16]** and and installing Windows servers via CDs. Um yeah, exactly. Some people

**[07:20]** CDs. Um yeah, exactly. Some people

**[07:20]** CDs. Um yeah, exactly. Some people remember CDs. And after that sort of

**[07:22]** remember CDs. And after that sort of

**[07:22]** remember CDs. And after that sort of sold that uh created the very first

**[07:23]** sold that uh created the very first

**[07:23]** sold that uh created the very first browserbased ID in 2009. So replet

**[07:27]** browserbased ID in 2009. So replet

**[07:27]** browserbased ID in 2009. So replet whatever 15 years ago. Um that was super

**[07:29]** whatever 15 years ago. Um that was super

**[07:29]** whatever 15 years ago. Um that was super early. So we had to create our own you

**[07:31]** early. So we had to create our own you

**[07:31]** early. So we had to create our own you know ids, our own orchestrators, our own

**[07:33]** know ids, our own orchestrators, our own

**[07:33]** know ids, our own orchestrators, our own isolation. Um more recently led the

**[07:37]** isolation. Um more recently led the

**[07:37]** isolation. Um more recently led the developer experience at a company called

**[07:39]** developer experience at a company called

**[07:39]** developer experience at a company called Infob. It's a multi-billion dollar

**[07:41]** Infob. It's a multi-billion dollar

**[07:41]** Infob. It's a multi-billion dollar company that competes with Twilio, which

**[07:42]** company that competes with Twilio, which

**[07:42]** company that competes with Twilio, which you haven't really heard of probably.

**[07:44]** you haven't really heard of probably.

**[07:44]** you haven't really heard of probably. Um, but basically, it's a communications

**[07:46]** Um, but basically, it's a communications

**[07:46]** Um, but basically, it's a communications platform as a service. So, one API for

**[07:48]** platform as a service. So, one API for

**[07:48]** platform as a service. So, one API for sending emails, SMS, voice, and all

**[07:51]** sending emails, SMS, voice, and all

**[07:51]** sending emails, SMS, voice, and all those nice things. And as of late, uh,

**[07:54]** those nice things. And as of late, uh,

**[07:54]** those nice things. And as of late, uh, working at Daytona with a bunch of

**[07:56]** working at Daytona with a bunch of

**[07:56]** working at Daytona with a bunch of people that I've worked with in my older

**[07:58]** people that I've worked with in my older

**[07:58]** people that I've worked with in my older companies, and I have to say, if anyone


### [08:00 - 09:00]

**[08:00]** companies, and I have to say, if anyone

**[08:00]** companies, and I have to say, if anyone has found is a founder or founding a

**[08:03]** has found is a founder or founding a

**[08:03]** has found is a founder or founding a company, if you can work with people

**[08:04]** company, if you can work with people

**[08:04]** company, if you can work with people that you've worked with historically,

**[08:07]** that you've worked with historically,

**[08:07]** that you've worked with historically, you should do that. It makes it so much

**[08:08]** you should do that. It makes it so much

**[08:08]** you should do that. It makes it so much more fun. Um so yeah, Daytona basically

**[08:12]** more fun. Um so yeah, Daytona basically

**[08:12]** more fun. Um so yeah, Daytona basically is a secure and elastic infrastructure

**[08:14]** is a secure and elastic infrastructure

**[08:14]** is a secure and elastic infrastructure purposely built for running AI generated

**[08:17]** purposely built for running AI generated

**[08:17]** purposely built for running AI generated code. Basically that means we created an

**[08:20]** code. Basically that means we created an

**[08:20]** code. Basically that means we created an agent native runtime. And what agent

**[08:21]** agent native runtime. And what agent

**[08:21]** agent native runtime. And what agent native means I'll hopefully explain a

**[08:23]** native means I'll hopefully explain a

**[08:24]** native means I'll hopefully explain a bit. Um or more simply like sandboxes.

**[08:27]** bit. Um or more simply like sandboxes.

**[08:27]** bit. Um or more simply like sandboxes. So we as Daytona give agents a computing

**[08:31]** So we as Daytona give agents a computing

**[08:31]** So we as Daytona give agents a computing environment that they can use to run

**[08:33]** environment that they can use to run

**[08:33]** environment that they can use to run code, do data anal analysis,

**[08:35]** code, do data anal analysis,

**[08:35]** code, do data anal analysis, reinforcement learning, computer use, or

**[08:37]** reinforcement learning, computer use, or

**[08:37]** reinforcement learning, computer use, or more recently I've seen people use it

**[08:38]** more recently I've seen people use it

**[08:38]** more recently I've seen people use it for agents to play video games like

**[08:41]** for agents to play video games like

**[08:41]** for agents to play video games like Counterstrike and whatnot. So um people

**[08:43]** Counterstrike and whatnot. So um people

**[08:43]** Counterstrike and whatnot. So um people are doing funny things with these

**[08:44]** are doing funny things with these

**[08:44]** are doing funny things with these things. Um and so Daytona is basically

**[08:47]** things. Um and so Daytona is basically

**[08:48]** things. Um and so Daytona is basically what a laptop is to a human. That is

**[08:50]** what a laptop is to a human. That is

**[08:50]** what a laptop is to a human. That is what a Daytona runtime is for an agent

**[08:52]** what a Daytona runtime is for an agent

**[08:52]** what a Daytona runtime is for an agent sort of. And so when we were starting to

**[08:55]** sort of. And so when we were starting to

**[08:55]** sort of. And so when we were starting to build this new company or this new

**[08:57]** build this new company or this new

**[08:57]** build this new company or this new product, we looked at what it means to


### [09:00 - 10:00]

**[09:00]** product, we looked at what it means to

**[09:00]** product, we looked at what it means to build something for agents and we took

**[09:01]** build something for agents and we took

**[09:01]** build something for agents and we took the principles of what agent experience

**[09:03]** the principles of what agent experience

**[09:03]** the principles of what agent experience is and these are the first things that

**[09:04]** is and these are the first things that

**[09:04]** is and these are the first things that sort of we built through that. And so

**[09:07]** sort of we built through that. And so

**[09:07]** sort of we built through that. And so one is speed. Basically, if you have a

**[09:10]** one is speed. Basically, if you have a

**[09:10]** one is speed. Basically, if you have a tool for an agent and your agent is in

**[09:13]** tool for an agent and your agent is in

**[09:13]** tool for an agent and your agent is in in interactive mode. So think of like

**[09:14]** in interactive mode. So think of like

**[09:14]** in interactive mode. So think of like cloud or chat GPD. If you're the user,

**[09:16]** cloud or chat GPD. If you're the user,

**[09:16]** cloud or chat GPD. If you're the user, you don't want to waste time for things

**[09:18]** you don't want to waste time for things

**[09:18]** you don't want to waste time for things for tools to turn on. So we created

**[09:20]** for tools to turn on. So we created

**[09:20]** for tools to turn on. So we created something that spins up in like 27

**[09:22]** something that spins up in like 27

**[09:22]** something that spins up in like 27 milliseconds. Um, obviously API first.

**[09:25]** milliseconds. Um, obviously API first.

**[09:25]** milliseconds. Um, obviously API first. So, can an agent via an API turn on a

**[09:27]** So, can an agent via an API turn on a

**[09:27]** So, can an agent via an API turn on a machine, turn it off, you know, clone

**[09:29]** machine, turn it off, you know, clone

**[09:29]** machine, turn it off, you know, clone it, delete it, whatnot.

**[09:31]** it, delete it, whatnot.

**[09:31]** it, delete it, whatnot. After that, we thought about what more

**[09:33]** After that, we thought about what more

**[09:33]** After that, we thought about what more things can it do? So, like it's really

**[09:34]** things can it do? So, like it's really

**[09:34]** things can it do? So, like it's really fast. The agent can spin it up, but what

**[09:36]** fast. The agent can spin it up, but what

**[09:36]** fast. The agent can spin it up, but what happens when it gets inside? And so, we

**[09:38]** happens when it gets inside? And so, we

**[09:38]** happens when it gets inside? And so, we thought it wasn't ideal for an agent to

**[09:40]** thought it wasn't ideal for an agent to

**[09:40]** thought it wasn't ideal for an agent to parse an output from a terminal. So, we

**[09:42]** parse an output from a terminal. So, we

**[09:42]** parse an output from a terminal. So, we re preloaded all of them with headless

**[09:44]** re preloaded all of them with headless

**[09:44]** re preloaded all of them with headless tools. So, a file explorer, git client,

**[09:46]** tools. So, a file explorer, git client,

**[09:46]** tools. So, a file explorer, git client, LSP, terminal, and all these things. And

**[09:49]** LSP, terminal, and all these things. And

**[09:49]** LSP, terminal, and all these things. And so this sort of aligns with the original

**[09:51]** so this sort of aligns with the original

**[09:51]** so this sort of aligns with the original definition is like we're helping agents

**[09:52]** definition is like we're helping agents

**[09:52]** definition is like we're helping agents do things faster. And we thought like

**[09:56]** do things faster. And we thought like

**[09:56]** do things faster. And we thought like that was it until we started getting

**[09:58]** that was it until we started getting

**[09:58]** that was it until we started getting like really interesting users and


### [10:00 - 11:00]

**[10:00]** like really interesting users and

**[10:00]** like really interesting users and customers that said like oh like

**[10:02]** customers that said like oh like

**[10:02]** customers that said like oh like our agent can't do this. And so we have

**[10:06]** our agent can't do this. And so we have

**[10:06]** our agent can't do this. And so we have to put in a human in that. And so I'm

**[10:08]** to put in a human in that. And so I'm

**[10:08]** to put in a human in that. And so I'm going to walk you through some of these

**[10:10]** going to walk you through some of these

**[10:10]** going to walk you through some of these new primitives, maybe a bigger word for

**[10:12]** new primitives, maybe a bigger word for

**[10:12]** new primitives, maybe a bigger word for that, but maybe not, were features that

**[10:15]** that, but maybe not, were features that

**[10:15]** that, but maybe not, were features that we found with new customers building

**[10:18]** we found with new customers building

**[10:18]** we found with new customers building agents on top of us. And these, just to

**[10:21]** agents on top of us. And these, just to

**[10:21]** agents on top of us. And these, just to be clear, I don't think these features

**[10:22]** be clear, I don't think these features

**[10:22]** be clear, I don't think these features are something that everyone can

**[10:23]** are something that everyone can

**[10:24]** are something that everyone can replicate, but it's more of like how we

**[10:26]** replicate, but it's more of like how we

**[10:26]** replicate, but it's more of like how we thought about solving these problems and

**[10:28]** thought about solving these problems and

**[10:28]** thought about solving these problems and how we seen these problems and maybe

**[10:30]** how we seen these problems and maybe

**[10:30]** how we seen these problems and maybe inspires you to think about how you're

**[10:32]** inspires you to think about how you're

**[10:32]** inspires you to think about how you're building your tools for agents. So the

**[10:35]** building your tools for agents. So the

**[10:35]** building your tools for agents. So the first thing is a declarative image

**[10:37]** first thing is a declarative image

**[10:37]** first thing is a declarative image builder. So Daytona is a sandbox. It

**[10:41]** builder. So Daytona is a sandbox. It

**[10:41]** builder. So Daytona is a sandbox. It uses any docker image off the shelf. Um

**[10:43]** uses any docker image off the shelf. Um

**[10:43]** uses any docker image off the shelf. Um so as a template and then the agent can

**[10:46]** so as a template and then the agent can

**[10:46]** so as a template and then the agent can you know spin up a sandbox with that

**[10:47]** you know spin up a sandbox with that

**[10:47]** you know spin up a sandbox with that template. Obviously if an agent needs to

**[10:50]** template. Obviously if an agent needs to

**[10:50]** template. Obviously if an agent needs to add a dependency it can use you know the

**[10:52]** add a dependency it can use you know the

**[10:52]** add a dependency it can use you know the API terminal and just like pip install

**[10:56]** API terminal and just like pip install

**[10:56]** API terminal and just like pip install whatever it wants. Great. But if an

**[10:58]** whatever it wants. Great. But if an

**[10:58]** whatever it wants. Great. But if an agent has to now install like 20 new

**[10:59]** agent has to now install like 20 new

**[10:59]** agent has to now install like 20 new things and do it over and over again,


### [11:00 - 12:00]

**[11:01]** things and do it over and over again,

**[11:01]** things and do it over and over again, that's just like a waste of time and

**[11:02]** that's just like a waste of time and

**[11:02]** that's just like a waste of time and resources. And the way you would solve

**[11:05]** resources. And the way you would solve

**[11:05]** resources. And the way you would solve that right now is like a human goes into

**[11:07]** that right now is like a human goes into

**[11:07]** that right now is like a human goes into Daytona, you know, creates the new

**[11:08]** Daytona, you know, creates the new

**[11:08]** Daytona, you know, creates the new Docker contain or goes to the laptop,

**[11:10]** Docker contain or goes to the laptop,

**[11:10]** Docker contain or goes to the laptop, creates a new Docker container, pushes

**[11:12]** creates a new Docker container, pushes

**[11:12]** creates a new Docker container, pushes to our container registry, and the agent

**[11:13]** to our container registry, and the agent

**[11:13]** to our container registry, and the agent can do that, but that like takes time

**[11:15]** can do that, but that like takes time

**[11:15]** can do that, but that like takes time and effort. The other option is like an

**[11:17]** and effort. The other option is like an

**[11:17]** and effort. The other option is like an agent tries to build a Docker image on

**[11:19]** agent tries to build a Docker image on

**[11:19]** agent tries to build a Docker image on its own and then push the container

**[11:20]** its own and then push the container

**[11:20]** its own and then push the container registry um which is brittle, takes

**[11:23]** registry um which is brittle, takes

**[11:23]** registry um which is brittle, takes time, breaks, and probably won't do very

**[11:25]** time, breaks, and probably won't do very

**[11:25]** time, breaks, and probably won't do very well. So how do you think about that?

**[11:28]** well. So how do you think about that?

**[11:28]** well. So how do you think about that? Well, we created something like a

**[11:30]** Well, we created something like a

**[11:30]** Well, we created something like a declarative image builder where an agent

**[11:31]** declarative image builder where an agent

**[11:31]** declarative image builder where an agent can say, "Oh, I need a net new one. This

**[11:34]** can say, "Oh, I need a net new one. This

**[11:34]** can say, "Oh, I need a net new one. This is my base image. These are the things I

**[11:35]** is my base image. These are the things I

**[11:35]** is my base image. These are the things I want installed. These are the run these

**[11:37]** want installed. These are the run these

**[11:37]** want installed. These are the run these commands. We build it on the fly and

**[11:39]** commands. We build it on the fly and

**[11:39]** commands. We build it on the fly and open up a sandbox." Basically, the agent

**[11:42]** open up a sandbox." Basically, the agent

**[11:42]** open up a sandbox." Basically, the agent can now at any moment in time say, "I

**[11:44]** can now at any moment in time say, "I

**[11:44]** can now at any moment in time say, "I need something net new, make it I can

**[11:46]** need something net new, make it I can

**[11:46]** need something net new, make it I can make it on my own and I can launch it on

**[11:49]** make it on my own and I can launch it on

**[11:49]** make it on my own and I can launch it on my own." Solves end to end for itself.

**[11:54]** my own." Solves end to end for itself.

**[11:54]** my own." Solves end to end for itself. The second thing is what we humans take

**[11:56]** The second thing is what we humans take

**[11:56]** The second thing is what we humans take for granted is if you're programming on

**[11:57]** for granted is if you're programming on

**[11:57]** for granted is if you're programming on your laptop, your environments are

**[11:59]** your laptop, your environments are

**[11:59]** your laptop, your environments are usually probably Docker containers on


### [12:00 - 13:00]

**[12:00]** usually probably Docker containers on

**[12:00]** usually probably Docker containers on your machine and you have if you have

**[12:02]** your machine and you have if you have

**[12:02]** your machine and you have if you have this large data set, you can really

**[12:04]** this large data set, you can really

**[12:04]** this large data set, you can really easily share it with all the

**[12:06]** easily share it with all the

**[12:06]** easily share it with all the environments that you have on your

**[12:07]** environments that you have on your

**[12:07]** environments that you have on your machine.

**[12:09]** machine.

**[12:09]** machine. But if an agent and we found some users

**[12:11]** But if an agent and we found some users

**[12:11]** But if an agent and we found some users that really need this, they need like

**[12:12]** that really need this, they need like

**[12:12]** that really need this, they need like 100 gigabyte data sets in every machine

**[12:14]** 100 gigabyte data sets in every machine

**[12:14]** 100 gigabyte data sets in every machine that they have.

**[12:17]** that they have.

**[12:17]** that they have. There is no local laptop context. Every

**[12:20]** There is no local laptop context. Every

**[12:20]** There is no local laptop context. Every environment is isolated on its own. So,

**[12:22]** environment is isolated on its own. So,

**[12:22]** environment is isolated on its own. So, how do you make it more efficient that

**[12:24]** how do you make it more efficient that

**[12:24]** how do you make it more efficient that an agent doesn't have to download

**[12:26]** an agent doesn't have to download

**[12:26]** an agent doesn't have to download something from or upload from S3 every

**[12:28]** something from or upload from S3 every

**[12:28]** something from or upload from S3 every single goddamn time? And so, basically

**[12:31]** single goddamn time? And so, basically

**[12:31]** single goddamn time? And so, basically created something called Daytona

**[12:32]** created something called Daytona

**[12:32]** created something called Daytona volumes. The agent can invoke one of

**[12:35]** volumes. The agent can invoke one of

**[12:35]** volumes. The agent can invoke one of these any size it wants, uploads it

**[12:37]** these any size it wants, uploads it

**[12:37]** these any size it wants, uploads it once, and maps it as a network drive or

**[12:41]** once, and maps it as a network drive or

**[12:41]** once, and maps it as a network drive or mounts as a network drive on every

**[12:42]** mounts as a network drive on every

**[12:42]** mounts as a network drive on every single machine.

**[12:47]** The last thing I'm just going to go

**[12:47]** The last thing I'm just going to go through and then we'll finish off on

**[12:48]** through and then we'll finish off on

**[12:48]** through and then we'll finish off on these feature stuff is quite different

**[12:50]** these feature stuff is quite different

**[12:50]** these feature stuff is quite different from the others, but I put it in here

**[12:52]** from the others, but I put it in here

**[12:52]** from the others, but I put it in here because I feel it's very much unique to

**[12:54]** because I feel it's very much unique to

**[12:54]** because I feel it's very much unique to agents and that is the ability to

**[12:57]** agents and that is the ability to

**[12:57]** agents and that is the ability to execute things in parallel. So an agent


### [13:00 - 14:00]

**[13:00]** execute things in parallel. So an agent

**[13:00]** execute things in parallel. So an agent unlike a human, we as humans can work on

**[13:02]** unlike a human, we as humans can work on

**[13:02]** unlike a human, we as humans can work on one machine, maybe two if we're super

**[13:04]** one machine, maybe two if we're super

**[13:04]** one machine, maybe two if we're super dialed in. Um

**[13:07]** dialed in. Um

**[13:07]** dialed in. Um an agent can try things in parallel all

**[13:11]** an agent can try things in parallel all

**[13:11]** an agent can try things in parallel all at once. So instead of going try this

**[13:13]** at once. So instead of going try this

**[13:13]** at once. So instead of going try this out outcome, it sucks, go back. Try it

**[13:16]** out outcome, it sucks, go back. Try it

**[13:16]** out outcome, it sucks, go back. Try it again, it sucks, go back. It can

**[13:18]** again, it sucks, go back. It can

**[13:18]** again, it sucks, go back. It can basically take a machine, fork it five

**[13:20]** basically take a machine, fork it five

**[13:20]** basically take a machine, fork it five times, 10 times, 100,000 times, go

**[13:22]** times, 10 times, 100,000 times, go

**[13:22]** times, 10 times, 100,000 times, go through all of these and then come to an

**[13:25]** through all of these and then come to an

**[13:25]** through all of these and then come to an output. And so again, these are just

**[13:28]** output. And so again, these are just
