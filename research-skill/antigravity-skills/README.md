## 📖 Quick Start

### 1. Prepare the Skills Library
First, clone this repository locally (it is recommended to place it in a fixed location for global reference):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/guanyang/antigravity-skills.git ~/antigravity-skills
```

### 2. Install Skills (Symlink Method)
We strongly recommend using **Symbolic Links (Symlink)** for installation, so that when you update this repository via `git pull`, all tools will automatically sync the latest features.

#### 🔹 Method A: Project Level Installation
Enable skills only for the current project. Run in your project root:
```bash
mkdir -p .agent/skills
ln -s ~/antigravity-skills/skills/* .agent/skills/
```

#### 🔹 Method B: Global Level Installation
Enable skills by default in all projects. Run the corresponding command based on the tool; common examples:

| Tool Name | Global Installation Command (macOS/Linux) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **General** | `mkdir -p ~/.agent/skills && ln -s ~/antigravity-skills/skills/* ~/.agent/skills/` |
| **Claude Code** | `mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && ln -s ~/antigravity-skills/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/` |
| **Antigravity** | `mkdir -p ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills && ln -s ~/antigravity-skills/skills/* ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/` |
| **Gemini** | `mkdir -p ~/.gemini/skills && ln -s ~/antigravity-skills/skills/* ~/.gemini/skills/` |
| **Codex** | `mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills && ln -s ~/antigravity-skills/skills/* ~/.codex/skills/` |

#### 🔹 Method C: Claude Plugin Installation (Claude Code Only)
If you primarily use **Claude Code**, you can install with one click via the plugin marketplace (this method automatically handles skill loading):

```bash
# 1. Start Claude Code
# 2. Add the plugin marketplace
/plugin marketplace add guanyang/antigravity-skills

# 3. Install the plugin from the marketplace
/plugin install antigravity-skills@antigravity-skills
```

### 3. Using Skills
Enter `@[skill-name]` or `/skill-name` in the chat box to invoke them, for example:
```text
/canvas-design Help me design a 16:9 blog cover about "Deep Learning"
```

### 4. More Information
- **View Manual**: For detailed usage, please refer to [docs/Antigravity_Skills_Manual.en.md](docs/Antigravity_Skills_Manual.en.md).
- **Environment Dependencies**: Some skills rely on Python environments; please ensure your system has necessary libraries installed (e.g., `pdf2docx`, `pandas`, etc.).


## 🔄 Keeping in Sync

Many skills in this project originate from excellent open-source communities. To keep in sync with upstream repositories, you can update them in the following ways:

1.  **Configuration**: The `skills_sources.json` file in the root directory is pre-configured with the upstream repositories for major skills and usually does not need manual adjustment.
2.  **Run Sync**:
    You can choose to sync all skills or just a specific one:

    ```bash
    # Sync all configured sources
    ./scripts/sync_skills.sh

    # Sync only a specific source (e.g., anthropics-skills)
    ./scripts/sync_skills.sh anthropics-skills
    ```
    The script will automatically pull the latest code and update the corresponding skill directories.

    > **Note**: The `ui-ux-pro-max` skill has a special directory structure and does not support automatic synchronization via script for now. Please use its official installation command `uipro init --ai antigravity` to install or update.
